# Authentication & Authorization

Authentication and authorization are fundamental aspects of security that ensure only legitimate users have access to specific resources.

## Authentication Best Practices:-

1. Use Secure Authentication Protocols - Implement OAuth2/OpenID Connect for secure authentication.
   - Use JWT (JSON Web Token) for stateless authentication in APIs.

2. Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
   - Require an additional authentication factor such as TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) or biometric authentication.

3. Secure Password Storage - Hash passwords using BCrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2 before storing them.
   - Enforce strong password policies with minimum complexity requirements.

4. Prevent Brute-Force Attacks - Implement account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts.
   - Use CAPTCHA to mitigate automated attacks.

## Authorization Best Practices:-

1. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - Define roles with minimum necessary privileges.
   - Enforce the principle of least privilege for user accounts.

2. Use Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) Where Necessary
   - Define fine-grained access controls based on user attributes (e.g., department, location).

3. Validate Authorization at Every Request - Do not assume a userâ€™s previous authorization applies to new actions.
   - Check permissions at both the frontend and backend.

4. Secure API Endpoints - Ensure proper authorization before processing API requests.
   - Implement scope-based access control for APIs.
