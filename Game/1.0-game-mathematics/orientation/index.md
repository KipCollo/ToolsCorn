# Orientation

In the context of game development, **Orientation** refers to the aspect or direction in which an object is pointed in a 3D space. To determine an object's orientation in 3D space, we typically use three angles namely: pitch, yaw, and roll collectively known as Euler's angles. **Pitch** is the rotation around the X-axis, **Yaw** around the Y-axis and **Roll** around the Z-axis. Alternatively, orientation can also be represented using a Quaternion. Quaternions have the advantage of avoiding a problem known as Gimbal lock (a loss of one degree of freedom in 3D space), present when using Euler's angles.

The `quaternion` is a complex number system that extends the concept of rotations in three dimensions. It involves four components: one real and three imaginary parts. Quaternions are used in game development for efficient and accurate calculations of rotations and orientation. They are particularly useful over other methods, such as Euler angles, due to their resistance to problems like Gimbal lock. Despite their complex nature, understanding and implementing quaternions can greatly enhance a game's 3D rotational mechanics and accuracy.


`Spline` is a mathematical function widely used in computer graphics for generating curves and surfaces. It connects two or more points through a smooth curve, often used in games for defining pathways, movement paths, object shapes, and flow control. Splines are not confined to two dimensions and can be extended to 3D or higher dimensions. Types of splines include `Linear`, `Cubic`, and `Bezier` splines. While linear splines generate straight lines between points, cubic and bezier splines provide more control and complexity with the addition of control points and handles. Developing a good understanding of splines and their usage can vastly improve the fluidity and visual aesthetics of a game.

The `Euler angle` is a concept in mathematics and physics used to describe the orientation of a rigid body or a coordinate system in 3D space. It uses three angles, typically named as alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ), and represents three sequential rotations around the axes of the original coordinate system. Euler angles can represent any rotation as a sequence of three elementary rotations. Keep in mind, however, that Euler angles are not unique, and different sequences of rotations can represent identical total effects. It's also noteworthy that Euler angles are prone to a problem known as gimbal lock, where the first and third axis align, causing a loss of a degree of freedom, and unpredictable behavior in particular orientations.

`Hermite` refers to Hermite interpolation, a fundamental technique in game development for executing smooth transitions. Essentially, Hermite interpolation is an application of polynomial mathematics, with two points applied as start/end (they're usually 3D positional vectors), and the tangents at these points controlling the curve's shape. The technique's name is derived from its inventor, Charles Hermite, a French mathematician. Hermite interpolation can be useful in different aspects of game development, such as creating smooth animations, camera paths, or motion patterns. Note, however, that while Hermite interpolation offers control over the start and end points of a sequence, it might not precisely predict the curve's full behavior.

`Bezier curves` are named after Pierre Bezier, a French engineer working at Renault, who used them in the 1960s for designing car bodies. A Bezier curve is defined by a set of control points with a minimum of two but no upper limit. The curve is calculated between the first and the last control point and does not pass through the controlling points, which only influence the direction of the curve. There are linear, quadratic, and cubic Bezier curves, but curves with more control points are also possible. They are widely used in computer graphics, animations, and are extensively used in vector images and tools to create shapes, texts, and objects.

The `Catmull-Rom` spline is a form of interpolation used in 2D and 3D graphics. Named after Edwin Catmull and Raphael Rom, it offers a simple way to smoothly move objects along a set of points or, in terms of graphics, to smoothly draw a curve connecting several points. It's a cubic interpolating spline, meaning it uses the cubic polynomial to compute coordinates. This makes Catmull-Rom ideal for creating smooth and natural curves in graphics and animation. It also has a feature called C1 continuity, ensuring the curve doesn't have any abrupt changes in direction. However, if not managed properly, it can create loops between points.
