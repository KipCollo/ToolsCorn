# Game Mathematics

"Game Mathematics" is a critical aspect of game development that deals with the use of mathematical concepts to create and control game mechanics. This involves areas such as geometry for 3D modelling, logic for game rules, algebra for scoring systems, and trigonometry for movements or trajectories. Understanding game mathematics enables developers to implement features like physics simulation, AI behaviours, and procedural generation. Advanced topics include complex calculations for graphics (e.g., shaders, lighting) and calculus for continuous animation or advanced physics. The mathematical complexity depends on the game's demands, but a solid foundation is crucial for any game developer.


`Linear Algebra` is a vital field in Mathematics that is extensively used in game development. It revolves around vector spaces and the mathematical structures used therein, including matrices, determinants, vectors, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors, among others. In the context of game development, linear algebra is used mainly for computer graphics, physics, AI, and many more. It allows developers to work with spatial transformations, helping them manipulate and critically interact with the 3D space of the game. On a broader context, it is important in computer programming for algorithms, parallax shifting, polygonal modeling, collision detection, etc. From object movements, positional calculations, game physics, to creating dynamism in games, linear algebra is key.

`Vector` in game development is a mathematical concept and an integral part of game physics. It represents a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. A vector can be used to represent different elements in a game like positions, velocities, accelerations, or directions. In 3D games, it's commonly used to define 3D coordinates (x, y, z). For example, if you have a character in a game and you want to move it up, you'd apply a vector that points upward. Hence, understanding how to manipulate vectors is a fundamental skill in game development.

`Matrix` - In game development, a **matrix** is a fundamental part of game mathematics. It's a grid of numbers arranged into rows and columns that's particularly important in 3D game development. These matrices are typically 4x4, meaning they contain 16 floating point numbers, and they're used extensively for transformations. They allow for the scaling, rotation, and translation (moving) of 3D vertices in space. With matrices, these transformations can be combined, and transformed vertices can be used to draw the replicas of 3D models into 2D screen space for rendering.

`Geometry` in game development refers to the mathematical study used to define the spatial elements within a game. This is vital in determining how objects interact within a game's environment. Particularly, geometry is employed in various aspects like object rendering, collision detection, character movement, and the calculation of angles and distance. It allows developers to create the spatial parameters for a game, including object dimensions and orientations. Understanding the basics such as 2D vs 3D, polygons, vertices, meshes and more advanced topics such as vectors, matrices, quaternions etc. is crucial to this field.

`Linear transformations` or `linear maps` are an important concept in mathematics, particularly in the fields of linear algebra and functional analysis. A linear transformation can be thought of as a transformation that preserves the operations of addition and scalar multiplication. In other words, a transformation T is linear if for every pair of vectors `x` and `y`, the equation T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y) holds true. Similarly, for any scalar `c` and any vector `x`, the equation T(cx)=cT(x) should also hold true. This property makes them very useful when dealing with systems of linear equations, matrices, and in many areas of computer graphics, including game development.

`Affine Space` - In the context of game mathematics, an **Affine Space** is a fundamental concept you should understand. It is a geometric structure with properties related to both geometry and algebra. The significant aspect of an affine space is that it allows you to work more comfortably with points and vectors. While a vector space on its own focuses on vectors which have both magnitude and direction, it does not involve points. An affine space makes it easy to add vectors to points or subtract points from each other to get vectors. This concept proves extremely useful in the field of game development, particularly when dealing with graphical models, animations, and motion control.

An `affine transformation`, in the context of game mathematics, is a function between affine spaces which preserves points, straight lines and planes. Also, sets of parallel lines remain parallel after an affine transformation. In video games, it's typically used for manipulating an object's position in 3D space. This operation allows game developers to perform multiple transformations such as translation (moving an object from one place to another), scaling (changing the size of an object), and rotation (spinning the object around a point). An important feature of affine transformation is that it preserves points uniqueness; if two points are distinct to start with, they remain distinct after transformation. It's important to note that these transformations are applied relative to an object's own coordinate system, not the world coordinate system.
