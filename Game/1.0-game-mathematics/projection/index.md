# Projection

`Projection` in game mathematics often refers to the method by which three-dimensional images are transferred to a two-dimensional plane, typically a computer screen. There are two main types of projection in game development; `Orthographic Projection` and `Perspective Projection`. In the Orthographic Projection, objects maintain their size regardless of their distance from the camera. This is often used in 2D games or 3D games where perspective is not important. On the other hand, Perspective Projection mimics human eye perspective, where distant objects appear smaller. This method provides a more realistic rendering for 3D games. It's crucial to understand projection in game development because it governs how virtual 3D spaces and objects are displayed on 2D viewing platforms.

In game development, **Perspective** plays a significant role in creating a three-dimensional world on a two-dimensional space. It mimics the way our eyes perceive distance and depth, with objects appearing smaller as they go farther away. Essentially, this is achieved by projecting 3D co-ordinates on a virtual screen. Perspective projection is done in two types - one-point where only one axis displays a change in size with depth and two-point where both axis display a change. It creates more realistic views, enhancing game visualization and immersion. An important aspect is the player's viewpoint, which is the vanishing point where parallel lines converge in the distance.


**Orthogonal** projection, or orthographic projection, is a type of parallelogram projection in game development where the lines of projection are perpendicular to the projection plane. This creates a view that is straight-on, essentially removing any form of perspective. Unlike perspective projection where objects further from the viewer appear smaller, objects in orthogonal projection remain the same size regardless of distance. The lack of perspective in orthogonal projection can be useful for specific types of games like platformers or strategy games. It is commonly used in CAD (Computer-Aided Design) and technical drawings as well.
