# Voice Over

VoiceOver is an assistive technology that enables people to experience the interface on their devices without having to see the screen. People who are blind or have low vision depend on VoiceOver to provide auditory feedback while using their devices, but VoiceOver can be useful to people in a wide variety of contexts. For example, someone prone to motion sickness might choose to turn VoiceOver on while they’re in a moving vehicle.

VoiceOver is a screen reader that enables people to experience an app’s interface without having to see the screen. With touch gestures on iOS and iPadOS, keyboard buttons on macOS, and remote buttons on tvOS, VoiceOver users can move through your app’s UI in reading order, from the top of the screen to the bottom, and receive descriptions in over 60 languages and locales of UI controls, text, and images audibly or in braille.
