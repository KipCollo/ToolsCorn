# Storyboards

A storyboard is a visual representation of the user interface of an iOS application, showing screens of content and the connections between those screens. A storyboard is composed of a sequence of scenes, each of which represents a view controller and its views; scenes are connected by segue objects, which represent a transition between two view controllers.

Xcode provides a visual editor for storyboards, where you can lay out and design the user interface of your application by adding views such as buttons, table views, and text views onto scenes. In addition, a storyboard enables you to connect a view to its controller object, and to manage the transfer of data between view controllers. Using storyboards is the recommended way to design the user interface of your application because they enable you to visualize the appearance and flow of your user interface on one canvas.
