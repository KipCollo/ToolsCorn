# History and Why Swift?

**History**

Swift was introduced by Apple in 2014 as a modern replacement for Objective-C.

It was developed to address the limitations and complexities of Objective-C, providing a more powerful and user-friendly programming language.

**Why Swift?**

Swift offers improved performance, safety, and readability. It reduces common programming errors with features like optionals and type inference.

Swiftâ€™s concise syntax and modern language constructs enhance developer productivity, making it easier to write and maintain code. Its open-source nature also allows a wider community to contribute and improve the language.
