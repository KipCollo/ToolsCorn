# Lottie

Lottie is a cross-platform library for iOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, Android, and Web that natively renders vector-based animations and art in realtime with minimal code.
Lottie loads and renders animations and vectors exported in the bodymovin JSON format. Bodymovin JSON can be created and exported from After Effects with bodymovin, Sketch with Lottie Sketch Export, and from Haiku.
