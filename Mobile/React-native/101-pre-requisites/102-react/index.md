# React Basics

React Native uses React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. You should have a basic understanding of React concepts before proceeding with React Native. Some of the concepts you should be familiar with include:

- [@official@Components](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component) and [Props](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component)
- [@official@Component State](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state)
- [@official@Writing Markup with JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx)
- [@official@JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces](https://react.dev/learn/javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces)

Once you have a basic understanding of React, start with React Native.
