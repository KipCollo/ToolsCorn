# Kotlin

Kotlin is a highly effective modern programming language developed by JetBrains.

The basic syntax of Kotlin is similar to Java, but it has numerous important differences. One of these features is extension features, which offer developers the ability to extend the functionality of classes without having to use inheritance. Moreover, Kotlin offers type inference, allowing the compiler to determine the type of variable based on context, which simplifies coding and reduces the number of errors in complex programs.

## History of Kotlin

In July 2011, JetBrains unveiled the Kotlin Project, a new language for the Java Platform, which had been in development for a year. The name comes from Kotlin Island near St. Petersburg, Russia. The primary goal of this project was to provide a safer and more concise alternative to Java in all the contexts where Java is currently used.

In 2016, the first official stable version was released (Kotlin v1.0). The developer community was already interested in using this language, especially on Android.

At the Google I/O 2017 conference, Google announced first-class support for Kotlin on Android.

## Application platforms for Kotlin: JVM, Android, JS, Native

Kotlin can be used in a variety of application platforms, such as JVM (Java Virtual Machine), Android, JavaScript, and Native. It is known for its flexibility and ease-of-use when it comes to developing software for different platforms.

For example, developers who are familiar with Java can easily learn how to use Kotlin on Android devices. The same is true for developers who are familiar with JavaScript and want to develop applications for the web using Kotlin.

1. JVM: Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, which means Kotlin works great with all existing Java source code and libraries. It also allows companies to make a gradual migration from Java to Kotlin because Java code can access Kotlin code, too. At the same time, developers can use Kotlin as the only language for their projects without Java at all.
2. Android: using Kotlin syntax, you can create mobile applications for Android, the most used operating system in the world.
3. JS: Kotlin is also compatible with JavaScript, which enables you to develop client-side web applications and run them in a browser.
4. Native: Kotlin/Native is a technology for compiling Kotlin code to native binaries which can be run on any OS such as Windows, Linux, iOS, and macOS.
5. Multiplatform: with Kotlin Multiplatform, you can build cross-platform mobile applications that share code between Android and iOS projects to implement networking, data storage and data validation, analytics, computations, and other application logic.

## Features: functional programming, object-oriented programming and more

Kotlin is designed as a pragmatic language, which means that its main purpose is solving real-world problems rather than completing research purposes.

It is also important that Kotlin supports multiple programming paradigms, such as imperative programming, object-oriented programming, generic programming, functional programming, and more. Kotlin also offers tools like anonymous functions and higher-order functions, which allow developers to easily create abstractions over existing code.

Kotlin is a tool-friendly language, which means all popular types of development tools, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and Android Studio, are compatible with it.

## Basic terminology

A `program `is a sequence of instructions (called statements), which are executed one after another in a predictable manner. Sequential flow is the most common and straightforward situation when statements are executed in the order they are written, i.e., from top to bottom, one after another;

A `statement` (or a programming statement) is a single command to be executed (like printing a text);

An `expression` is a piece of code that produces a single value (for example, 2*2 is an expression);

A `block` is a group of zero or more statements enclosed in a pair of curly braces {...}; our program consists of a single block;

A `keyword` is a word that has a special meaning in the programming language. Names of keywords can't be changed;

An `identifier` (or a name) is a word written by the programmer to identify something;

A `comment` is a piece of text that is ignored when executing the program â€“ it just explains a part of the code. Comments start with //;

`Whitespace` is a blank area, a tab, or a newline; it is used to separate words in the program and to improve readability.
