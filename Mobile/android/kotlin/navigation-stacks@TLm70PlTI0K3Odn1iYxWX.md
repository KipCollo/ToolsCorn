# Navigation Stacks

iOS 16 introduced a new concept of navigating through SiwftUI apps: NavigationStack.
NavigationStack is data-driven, meaning that you specify navigationDestinations for each data type (models) that your app supports.
These destinations are defined once for each NavigationStack and are valid throughout the app.
Navigation itself is handled through the NavigationLink View, which allows setting a label and a value (your model).
