# Memory Management

Memory management involves allocating memory for objects and freeing it after use. Manual Retain-Release (MRR) requires developers to explicitly manage memory using reference counting, provided by the Foundation class NSObject. Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) automates this process by inserting memory management method calls during compilation, though it still uses reference counting. In contrast, Garbage Collection (GC) automatically tracks object ownership and releases unreferenced objects, using a different mechanism than MRR and ARC, and is supported only in the Mac OS X runtime environment, not on iOS.

> Beginning May 1, 2015, new Mac apps and app updates submitted to the Mac App Store may no longer use garbage collection, which was deprecated in OS X Mountain Lion. Instead, migrate your apps to Automatic Reference Counting, using the migration assistant in Xcode to help with this transition. Apps may continue to use retain/release for manual memory management.
