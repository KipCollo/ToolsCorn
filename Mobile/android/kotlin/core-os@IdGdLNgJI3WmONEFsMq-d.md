# Core OS

The Core OS layer in iOS is the foundation upon which the entire operating system is built, providing essential low-level services that ensure the systemâ€™s security, performance, and efficiency. This layer includes the kernel, which manages system resources and hardware abstraction, and device drivers that facilitate communication between the OS and hardware. Core OS also encompasses security frameworks, such as the Secure Enclave for handling encryption keys and biometric data, and Keychain Services for secure storage of sensitive information.

Core OS supports essential functionalities like the Apple File System (APFS), which offers features like encryption and snapshotting, efficient memory management, and robust networking capabilities. It also includes power management features to extend battery life, inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms for multitasking, and core system libraries like libdispatch for concurrency. By providing these foundational services, Core OS ensures that higher-level software can operate efficiently and securely on iOS devices.
