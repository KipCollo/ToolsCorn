# Interoperability with Swift

Swift is designed to work seamlessly with Objective-C, allowing developers to integrate and use both languages within the same project. This interoperability enables:

**Gradual Migration:** Developers can incrementally migrate their codebase from Objective-C to Swift without needing a complete rewrite.

**Mixed-Language Projects:** Swift and Objective-C files can coexist, and developers can call Objective-C code from Swift and vice versa.

**Access to Existing Libraries:** Swift code can leverage existing Objective-C libraries and frameworks, ensuring continued use of valuable resources and tools.

**Bridging Header:** A bridging header file allows Swift to interface with Objective-C code, facilitating communication between the two languages.

**Compatibility:** Swift supports dynamic libraries, ensuring compatibility with existing Objective-C runtime and APIs.
