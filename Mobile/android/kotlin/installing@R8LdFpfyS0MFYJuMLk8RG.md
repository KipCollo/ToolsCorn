# Installing

The Xcode Integrated Development Environment (IDE) can only be installed on MacOS given it's nature as an iOS IDE. It can be installed simply like any application on the Mac, via the iStore using an Apple ID.

If you wish to do any development using the Command Line Interface (CLI) you will need to install Xcode Command Line Tools via the `Xcode-select --install`. Popular CLI tools such as `clang`, `gcc` & `git` will require the installation of Xcode Command Line Tools.
