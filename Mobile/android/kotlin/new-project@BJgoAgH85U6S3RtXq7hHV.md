To create an Xcode project for your app, select a platform template such as iOS, macOS, watchOS, or tvOS, and choose the type of app you want to develop, like a single view, game, or document-based app. Xcode templates provide essential configuration and files, allowing you to quickly start developing your app. This setup helps streamline the initial stages of app development.
