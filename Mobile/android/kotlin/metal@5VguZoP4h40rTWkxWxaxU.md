# Metal

Metal is a high-performance graphics and compute framework for iOS, macOS, and tvOS, designed by Apple. It enables developers to harness the full power of the GPU for advanced 3D graphics, complex visual effects, and data-parallel computation. Metal provides low-level, low-overhead access to the GPU, allowing for fine-tuned performance optimizations in applications and games.
