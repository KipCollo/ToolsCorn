# Flutter

Flutter is an open-source user interface software development kit(app SDK) created by google.Used for building high performance,high-fidelity apps for IOS,Android, and web from single codebase.

Advantages of flutter include:-
1. Highly productive:-
   - Develop IOS and Android from a single codebase.
   - Prototype and iterate easily where you can change your code and reload it as your app runs(hot reload feature) and also fixes crashes and continue debugging from where the app is left off.
2. Create beautiful,highly-customized user experience(UI):-
   - Rich set of Material design and Cupertino(iOS-flavor) widgets using Flutter's own framework.
   - Custom.beautiful,brand-driven designs without limitations of OEM widget sets.

## Flutter Framework

The Flutter framework is organized into a series of layers.Each layer is built upon the previous layer.The upper layer is more frequently used thgan the lower layers.

You can compose the ready-made widgets Flutter provoides, or create your custom widgets using same tools and techniques that flutter Team uses to build the framework.

## Hot Reload

Flutter's hot reload feature helps you quickly and easily experiment,build UIs,add features and fix bugs.Hot reload works by injecting updated source code files into the running Dart Virtual Machine(VM).After the VM updates classes with newer versions of fields and functions,the Flutter framework automatically rebuilds your app structure,allowing you to quickly view the effects of your changes.
