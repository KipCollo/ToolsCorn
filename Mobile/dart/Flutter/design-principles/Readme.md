## Design Principles

Flutter development emphasizes design principles like Material Design, responsiveness, user-centeredness, simplicity, consistency, accessibility, and performance to create visually appealing and user-friendly applications that function seamlessly across various devices and cater to diverse user needs.


`Dependency Injection` is a design pattern that allows objects to receive their dependencies from external sources instead of creating them internally. In Flutter, this can be useful for managing complex state, reducing coupling between components, and making testing easier.

`Design patterns` are solutions to common problems in software development that can be used to improve the quality and maintainability of your code.

`Object-oriented programming (OOP)` is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "objects," which are instances of a class. In OOP, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, which have both data (attributes) and behavior (methods). The main idea behind OOP is to model real-world objects and their interactions, making it well-suited for creating complex and large-scale software systems.

`SOLID` is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
