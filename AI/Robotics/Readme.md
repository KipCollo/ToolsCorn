# Robotics

Webots is a free and open-source 3D robot simulator. It allows you to create 3D simulation models of robots interacting with their environment through sensors and actuators. Libraries of robots, sensors, actuators and objects are provided, but you can create your own. Collision detections, rigid body dynamics and fluid dynamics rely on a modified version of the ODE physics engine. The robot controller programs can be written outside of Webots in C, C++, Python, ROS, Java or MATLAB using a simple API. Webots features a 3D web interface allowing you to publish simulations online.

## Camera

Derived from Device and Solid.
The Camera node is used to model a robot's on-board camera. The resulting image can be displayed on the 3D window. Depending on its setup, the Camera node can model a linear camera, a typical RGB camera or even a fish eye which is spherically distorted.
