# Compute

AWS offers a variety of compute services designed to meet different application needs, from virtual machines to serverless computing. Below are some key AWS compute services:

1. Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

    Provides resizable virtual machines (instances).
    Offers multiple instance types (e.g., General Purpose, Compute Optimized, Memory Optimized).
    Supports auto-scaling, load balancing, and elastic IPs.

2. AWS Lambda

    Serverless computing service that runs code in response to events.
    Supports various languages (Python, Node.js, Java, etc.).
    Charges based on execution time and memory usage.

3. Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)

    Fully managed container orchestration for Docker containers.
    Works with AWS Fargate for serverless container management.
    Supports integration with AWS networking, security, and monitoring tools.

4. Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

    Managed Kubernetes service for containerized applications.
    Simplifies deployment and scaling of Kubernetes workloads.
    Integrates with AWS services like IAM, VPC, and CloudWatch.

5. AWS Fargate

    Serverless compute engine for containers.
    Eliminates the need to manage infrastructure.
    Works with both ECS and EKS.

6. AWS Batch

    Manages and runs batch computing workloads.
    Dynamically provisions compute resources based on job requirements.
    Works with EC2 and Spot Instances.

7. Amazon Lightsail

    Simplified cloud compute for small applications, websites, and databases.
    Provides virtual servers with pre-configured environments.
    Includes networking, storage, and security.

8. AWS Outposts

    Brings AWS compute and storage to on-premises environments.
    Ideal for hybrid cloud deployments.
    Works seamlessly with AWS services.

9. AWS Wavelength

    Provides ultra-low latency computing at the edge of 5G networks.
    Optimized for applications like IoT, AR/VR, and real-time analytics.

10. AWS Local Zones

    Extends AWS services closer to users in specific locations.
    Helps reduce latency for gaming, media, and real-time applications.

11. Amazon Elastic Beanstalk

    PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) for deploying and managing applications.
    Supports multiple programming languages (Java, Python, Node.js, etc.).
    Automatically handles scaling and deployment.

12. VMware Cloud on AWS

    Enables running VMware workloads on AWS infrastructure.
    Supports hybrid cloud strategies.
    Provides integration with AWS services.
