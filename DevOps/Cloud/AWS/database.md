## Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks.

Amazon RDS offers traditional relational databases as fully managed services on the AWS platform. Ideal for transactional database requirements, also known as OLTP, AWS offers six different database engines, as follows:

1. MySQL
2. PostgreSQL
3. MariaDB
4. Microsoft SQL server
5. Oracle
6. Amazon Aurora
