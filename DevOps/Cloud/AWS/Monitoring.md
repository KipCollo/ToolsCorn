4. Enables proactive detection and resolution of potential issues, reducing downtime.
5. Critical for maintaining security and identifying suspicious activities.

## Aspects of AWS Monitoring

1. Performance Optimization: Use monitoring tools to track response times, server health, and resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk usage). Identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.
