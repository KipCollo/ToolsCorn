# What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is a term used to describe the on-demand access to IT services that comprise compute, network, storage, and software services from third-party suppliers,usually via the public internet or some form of direct wide-area network (WAN) access.

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Cloud Computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet instead of using local servers. It offers reliable, scalable, and inexpensive cloud computing services which include data storage, databases, applications, analytics, machine learning, and even setting up virtual servers. The biggest names providing cloud computing services are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and others. The main selling point is that you only pay for the services you use, helping you manage your expenses more effectively.

## IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS

IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS are three types of cloud service models. **IaaS** or Infrastructure as a Service provides users with a resource-based service via virtualization technology, offering computing infrastructure, physical or (more often) virtual machines and other resources. **PaaS** or Platform as a Service provides runtime environments for developing, testing, and managing applications, it is utilized for software development and offers a platform to developers to build applications and services over the internet. **SaaS** or Software as a Service provides on-demand software accessed via the internet, it delivers a complete software solution that you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider.

## cloud deployment models

There are three primary models of deployment, listed as follows:
• Public cloud
• Private cloud
• Hybrid cloud

A `Public Cloud` is a model where the service provider offers resources, such as applications and storage, available to the general public over the internet. Resources may be free, or sold on a pay-per-usage model.also known as Cloud-Native or Cloud First.Most prominent examples are the top three providers - Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure, who offer a comprehensive public cloud platform offering a myriad of services such as virtual machines, databases, and AI capabilities. Other notable players are Alibaba Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), and DigitalOcean who offer similar features.

A `Private Cloud` is a type of cloud computing that delivers similar advantages to public cloud, including scalability and self-service, but through a proprietary architecture dedicated to a single organization. Unlike public clouds, which deliver services to multiple organizations, a private cloud is dedicated to the needs and goals of a single entity.Also known as On-Premise. There are many tools, like OpenStack, Hyper-V, XenServer, KVM, or VMware's vSphere, who empower organizations to establish a private cloud within their own data centers, ensuring meticulous control and customization of resources.

A `Hybrid Cloud` is a solution that combines a private cloud with one or more public cloud services, with proprietary software enabling communication between each distinct service.Azure Hybrid Cloud, VMware Cloud Foundation, and CloudHesive are prime examples, seamlessly integrating on-premises servers with public cloud services, delivering a unified management experience.

A `Cross-Cloud` Using multiple cloud providers.Also known as multi-cloud.A multi-cloud strategy involves leveraging services from multiple cloud providers to avoid vendor lock-in, enhance redundancy, and optimize costs. For example, organizations might use AWS for machine learning, Azure for integration services, and Google Cloud for data analytics, creating a diversified cloud ecosystem.

`Community Cloud` Community clouds are shared among multiple organizations with shared concerns, such as regulatory compliance. These organizations collaborate within the cloud to fulfill their collective objectives. For instance, government agencies within a region might opt for a community cloud adhering to specific regulations governing data storage and security.

## Benefits of cloud computing

1. Agility - The cloud gives you easy access to a broad range of technologies so that you can innovate faster and build nearly anything that you can imagine. You can quickly spin up resources as you need them–from infrastructure services, such as compute, storage, and databases, to Internet of Things, machine learning, data lakes and analytics, and much more.You can deploy technology services in a matter of minutes, and get from idea to implementation several orders of magnitude faster than before. This gives you the freedom to experiment, test new ideas to differentiate customer experiences, and transform your business.
2. Elasticity - With cloud computing, you don’t have to over-provision resources up front to handle peak levels of business activity in the future. Instead, you provision the amount of resources that you actually need. You can scale these resources up or down to instantly grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change.
3. Cost savings - The cloud allows you to trade fixed expenses (such as data centers and physical servers) for variable expenses, and only pay for IT as you consume it. Plus, the variable expenses are much lower than what you would pay to do it yourself because of the economies of scale.
4. Stop guessing capacity: Traditionally, while carrying out capacity planning, you would procure necessary hardware components for future growth. Predicting future growth is extremely difficult, and this often meant that you would overprovision your environment. The result would be expensive idle resources simply going to waste. The fact that you would have made large CAPEX to acquire those components would ultimately be detrimental to the balance sheet due to the rapid loss in value arising from depreciation.
5. Increase speed and agility: Cloud vendors such as AWS enable you to launch and configure new IT resources in a few mouse clicks—for example, you can provision a new fleet of servers for your developers within minutes, allowing your organization to exponentially increase its agility in building infrastructure and launching applications.

Go global in minutes: AWS host their data centers in various regions across the globe.

## Types of cloud computing

The three main types of cloud computing include Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service. Each type of cloud computing provides different levels of control, flexibility, and management so that you can select the right set of services for your needs.

- `Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)`:- IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS gives you the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources. It is most similar to the existing IT resources with which many IT departments and developers are familiar.

- `Platform as a Service (PaaS)`:- PaaS removes the need for you to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems), and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.

- `Software as a Service (SaaS)`:- SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to SaaS are referring to end-user applications (such as web-based email). With a SaaS offering, you don’t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how you will use that particular software.

## cloud services

Cloud services are IT resources managed by AWS and delivered on demand over the internet. Traditionally, organizations had to purchase and configure everything from server hardware and storage systems to networking and security technologies before launching any digital system. Provisioning and managing IT infrastructure is expensive, complicated; and takes time away from innovation.

Cloud services allow anyone to access the IT infrastructure needed to build and maintain digital systems, abstracting complex infrastructure so anyone can build sophisticated applications quickly and scale globally.
