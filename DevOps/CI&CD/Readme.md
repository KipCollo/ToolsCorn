# Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

`Continuous Integration` is the first part of the process and describes the permanent building and testing of the written code. High automation and usage of version control allows multiple developers and teams to work on the same code base.

`Continuous Delivery` is the second part of the process and automates the deployment of the pre-built software. In cloud environments, you will often see that software is deployed to Development or Staging environments, before it gets released and delivered to a production system.
Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software development practice that aims to automate the process of releasing software changes to production environments in a frequent and reliable manner. It builds upon the concept of Continuous Integration (CI) by extending the automated pipeline to include deployment and release processes. In continuous delivery, the goal is to have software in a state where it can be released to production at any given time.

`Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)` is a software development approach that combines the practices of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery to automate the entire software delivery pipeline, from code changes to production deployment. A CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building images, running tests, and deploying software updates. It minimizes manual errors, provides developer feedback, and enables rapid product iterations.

To automate the whole workflow, you can use a CI/CD pipeline, which is actually nothing more than the scripted form of all the steps involved, running on a server or even in a container. Pipelines should be integrated with a version control system that manages changes to the code base.

Every time a new revision of your code is ready to be deployed, the pipeline starts to execute scripts that build your code, run tests, deploy them to servers and even perform security and compliance checks.Besides the generic scripting of the pipeline steps, modern CI/CD tools have a lot more functionality like direct interaction and feedback from a system like Kubernetes.

Popular CI/CD tools include:

1. Spinnaker
2. GitLab
3. Jenkins
4. Jenkins X
5. Tekton CD
6. ArgoCD

## Continuous Integration?

Continuous Integration (CI) is a pivotal methodology in software development, reshaping the way teams collaborate and deliver high-quality code. At its core, CI involves the regular merging of code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository. This iterative process serves as a proactive measure to identify and rectify integration issues at an early stage, fostering a development environment characterized by stability and efficiency.

In the world of CI, the mantra is frequent integration. Unlike traditional development approaches, where code integration might occur infrequently, CI encourages developers to merge their code multiple times a day. This frequent integration is accompanied by an automated build process, a cornerstone of CI. The build process includes tasks such as code compilation, automated testing, and the creation of executable artifacts. The automation ensures that the codebase is consistently and reliably built, reducing variability and ensuring a standardized output.

Automated testing is another integral component of CI. Developers leverage various types of tests, including unit tests and integration tests, to validate the correctness of their code. This emphasis on automated testing serves a dual purpose: it verifies that the newly integrated code functions as expected, and it provides a safety net for catching regressions and defects.

A key feature of CI is the immediate feedback loop. Developers receive prompt notifications about the success or failure of their code integration. This rapid feedback allows for quick identification and resolution of issues, preventing the accumulation of defects that could lead to more complex problems down the line.

The benefits of CI extend across various dimensions of the development process. Early bug detection is a significant advantage, as issues are identified and addressed in their infancy. The consistent codebase resulting from frequent integration facilitates collaboration among team members, fostering a shared understanding of the project's state. Confidence in code quality is heightened through the combination of automated builds and tests, empowering developers to make changes with the assurance that issues will be promptly discovered and rectified.

CI sets the stage for improved collaboration, increased efficiency, and streamlined deployment processes. By cultivating a culture of continuous integration, teams can respond more effectively to changing requirements and market dynamics. Ultimately, CI is more than a development practice; it's a fundamental mindset shift that prioritizes collaboration, quality, and agility in the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering.

`Continuous Integration (CI) Principles`;-

Frequent Code Integration

Developers integrate their code changes into a shared repository frequently, ensuring that the codebase is continuously evolving in a collaborative manner.
Automated Builds

Every integration triggers an automated build process, including compiling the code, running tests, and creating executable artifacts. Automation ensures consistency and reliability.
Automated Testing

A comprehensive suite of automated tests, including unit tests and integration tests, is run with each integration to detect and address issues early in the development process.
Immediate Feedback

Developers receive immediate feedback on the success or failure of their code integration. Quick feedback allows for prompt issue resolution, reducing the risk of defects accumulating.

`Continuous Integration (CI) Practices`

Version Control

Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage code changes, enabling collaboration, tracking history, and providing a reliable mechanism for rollbacks.
Automated Builds

Set up automated build processes triggered by code commits. These processes should compile the code, run tests, and produce deployable artifacts.
Automated Testing

Develop and maintain a suite of automated tests to validate the correctness and functionality of the code. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and possibly end-to-end tests.
Continuous Integration Server

Employ a CI server (e.g., Jenkins, Travis CI) to automate the integration and testing process. The CI server monitors the version control system and triggers builds and tests upon code changes.


## Continuous Delivery (CD)?

Continuous Delivery is a software development practice that extends the principles of Continuous Integration to ensure that the codebase is always in a deployable state. The primary objective is to make software releases reliable, predictable, and sustainable. In a Continuous Delivery pipeline, automated testing, and deployment processes are integral components.

1. Automated Testing - Similar to Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery places a strong emphasis on automated testing. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and other forms of testing that validate the correctness and functionality of the codebase.
2. Deployment Automation - Continuous Delivery involves automating the deployment process to create a consistent and repeatable method of releasing software. While the deployment to production may not occur automatically, the process leading up to deployment is automated.
3. Deployment to Staging or Pre-Production - In Continuous Delivery, the software is typically deployed to a staging or pre-production environment where additional testing, user acceptance testing, or other validation processes can take place. This allows teams to ensure that the software is ready for production release.
4. Manual Intervention for Production Release - Unlike Continuous Deployment, Continuous Delivery stops short of automatically deploying changes to the production environment. The decision to release to production requires human intervention, providing an additional layer of control and oversight.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)?

Continuous Deployment takes the principles of Continuous Delivery a step further by automatically deploying every code change that passes automated testing directly to the production environment. The goal is to maximize efficiency and deliver new features or bug fixes to end-users as quickly as possible.

1. Automated Production Deployment - The hallmark of Continuous Deployment is the automatic deployment of code changes to the production environment once they pass automated tests. This minimizes manual intervention in the release process.
2. Immediate User Access - With Continuous Deployment, new features or fixes become immediately accessible to end-users. This rapid deployment cycle allows for quick responses to user feedback and changing market conditions.
3. High Level of Automation - Continuous Deployment relies heavily on automation throughout the entire development pipeline, from code integration to deployment. Automated testing and deployment scripts play a crucial role in achieving this level of automation.

Principles

Consistent Deployment Process

Ensure that the deployment process is consistent and repeatable, reducing the risk of errors and ensuring that each release is reliable.
Automated Deployment

Automate the deployment process to create a streamlined and efficient method for releasing software. This includes deploying to staging environments for additional testing.

    Environment Parity

    Strive for parity between different environments, such as development, staging, and production, to minimize issues related to environment-specific differences.

Practices

Continuous Delivery

In Continuous Delivery, automated processes ensure that the software is always in a deployable state. Deployment to production requires human intervention, allowing for a final review and decision before release.
Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment takes automation a step further, automatically deploying changes to the production environment once they pass automated tests. Human intervention is minimized in the release process.
Feature Toggles

Use feature toggles or feature flags to enable or disable specific features in production. This allows for the decoupling of deployment and release, enabling the gradual rollout of features.
Rollback Mechanisms

Implement mechanisms to quickly rollback releases in case of unexpected issues. This ensures a rapid response to problems without causing extended downtime.
Monitoring and Logging

Implement robust monitoring and logging to track the performance and behavior of the application in real-time. This facilitates rapid identification and resolution of issues in production.

## Understanding Release Strategies

Release strategies play a crucial role in the software development lifecycle, determining how and when new features, enhancements, and bug fixes are delivered to end-users. Different release strategies offer varying degrees of control, risk management, and flexibility.
Rolling Release

In a rolling release strategy, new features and updates are continuously and incrementally released as soon as they are ready. There are no distinct version numbers or major releases. The software is always in a state of evolution.

Characteristics:

    Continuous Updates: Changes are released frequently without a fixed release schedule.
    No Version Numbers: No need for version numbers or major releases.
    Incremental Improvements: Users consistently receive small, incremental improvements.

Use Cases:

    Web applications and services that can be updated seamlessly without user disruption.
    Software where continuous evolution and rapid delivery of features are critical.

Feature Toggles (Feature Flags)

Feature toggles involve wrapping new features in conditional statements that can be controlled externally. This allows developers to enable or disable features without modifying code, providing flexibility in managing feature releases.

Characteristics:

    Selective Activation: Features can be selectively activated or deactivated.
    Gradual Rollout: Enables a gradual rollout of features to specific user groups.
    Rapid Experimentation: Facilitates A/B testing and rapid experimentation.

Use Cases:

    Testing new features with a subset of users.
    Safely releasing features that might be turned off if issues arise.

Blue-Green Deployment:

In a blue-green deployment, two environments (blue and green) are maintained. One environment serves as the production environment (e.g., blue), while the other is used for deploying and testing new releases (e.g., green). The switch between environments determines the active production version.

Characteristics:

    Zero Downtime: Deployment and testing of new releases occur without affecting the production environment.
    Quick Rollback: If issues are detected, switching back to the previous environment is quick.

Use Cases:

    Web applications where downtime is not acceptable.
    Ensuring seamless transition between releases in critical systems.

Canary Release:

Canary releases involve deploying a new version of the software to a small subset of users (the "canaries") before a full release. This allows for real-world testing and monitoring of the new version's performance.

Characteristics:

    Gradual Rollout: Starts with a small percentage of users and gradually increases.
    Real-time Monitoring: Performance and user feedback are closely monitored during the canary phase.
    Risk Mitigation: Identifies and addresses issues before a full release.

Use Cases:

    Web and mobile applications where real-world user feedback is valuable.
    Minimizing the impact of potential issues on a small user subset.

Phased (Staged) Rollout

In a phased rollout, the new version is released to a limited subset of users initially and then progressively to a broader audience over time. Each phase allows for monitoring and addressing issues before expanding to the next group.

Characteristics:

    Controlled Progression: Release occurs in predefined stages.
    Feedback and Monitoring: Each stage allows for user feedback and issue monitoring.
    Risk Mitigation: Issues can be addressed before a full release.

Use Cases:

    Large-scale applications with diverse user bases.
    Ensuring stability and performance in a controlled manner.

Choosing the right release strategy depends on factors such as the nature of the software, the user base, the acceptable level of risk, and the organization's development and deployment practices. Often, a combination of these strategies is used to balance rapid delivery with risk management and user experience considerations.
