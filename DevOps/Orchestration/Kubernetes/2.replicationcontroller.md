# REPLICATIONCONTROLLER

It makes sure there’s always exactly one instance of your pod running. Generally, ReplicationControllers are used to replicate pods (that is, create multiple copies of a pod) and keep them running.

If you dodn’t specify how many pod replicas you want, so the ReplicationController creates a single one. If your pod were to disappear for any reason, the
ReplicationController would create a new pod to replace the missing one.

One of the main benefits of using Kubernetes is the simplicity with which you can scale your deployments. Let’s see how easy it is to scale up the number of pods. You’ll
increase the number of running instances to three.

```bash
kubectl get replicationcontroller
```

To scale up the number of replicas of your pod, you need to change the desired replica count on the ReplicationController like this:

```bash
kubectl scale rc kubia --replicas=3
```
