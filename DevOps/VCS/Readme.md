# Version Control

TODO central vs distribured version control

In central control (e.g dropbox, OneDrive)- When you change the file it also changes in the computer server and reflect to other people the old version is stored on the server but not on local computers.If something happens to server we only work with latest version and lose history.In distributed we still have remote server but every client that uses the file has their own databse with history and snapshots.If something happens to server we still have all the files and it's history
