## DockerHub

[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) is a cloud-based registry service provided by Docker Inc. It is the default public container registry where you can store, manage, and distribute your Docker images. DockerHub makes it easy for other users to find and use your images or to share their own images with the Docker community.

## Features of DockerHub

- **Public and private repositories:** Store your images in public repositories that are accessible to everyone, or opt for private repositories with access limited to your team or organization.

- **Automated Builds:** DockerHub integrates with popular code repositories such as GitHub and Bitbucket, allowing you to set up automated builds for your Docker images. Whenever you push code to the repository, DockerHub will automatically create a new image with the latest changes.

- **Webhooks:** DockerHub allows you to configure webhooks to notify other applications or services when an image has been built or updated.

- **Organizations and Teams:** Make collaboration easy by creating organizations and teams to manage access to your images and repositories.

- **Official Images:** DockerHub provides a curated set of official images for popular software like MongoDB, Node.js, Redis, etc. These images are maintained by Docker Inc. and the upstream software vendor, ensuring that they are up-to-date and secure.

To start using DockerHub, you need to create a free account on their website. Once you've signed up, you can create repositories, manage organizations and teams, and browse the available images.

When you're ready to share your own images, you can use the `docker` command line tool to push your local images to DockerHub:

```bash
docker login
docker tag your-image your-username/your-repository:your-tag
docker push your-username/your-repository:your-tag
```

To pull images from DockerHub, you can use the `docker pull` command:

```bash
docker pull your-username/your-repository:your-tag
```

DockerHub is essential for distributing and sharing Docker images, making it easier for developers to deploy applications and manage container infrastructure.

By exploring these options, you can find the most suitable container registry for your project.

- Image Tagging Best Practices

Properly tagging your Docker images is crucial for efficient container management and deployment. In this section, we will discuss some best practices for image tagging.

## Use Semantic Versioning

When tagging your image, it is recommended to follow [Semantic Versioning guidelines](https://semver.org/). Semantic versioning is a widely recognized method that can help better maintain your application. Docker image tags should have the following structure `<major_version>.<minor_version>.<patch>`. Example: `3.2.1`.

## Tag the Latest Version

Docker allows you to tag an image as 'latest' in addition to a version number. It is a common practice to tag the most recent stable version of your image as 'latest' so that users can quickly access it without having to specify a version number. However, it is important to keep this tag updated as the new versions are released.

```sh
docker build -t your-username/app-name:latest .
```

## Be Descriptive and Consistent

Choose clear and descriptive tag names that convey the purpose of the image or changes from the previous version. Your tags should also be consistent across your images and repositories for better organization and ease of use.

## Include Build and Git Information (Optional)

In some situations, it might be helpful to include information about the build and Git commit in the image tag. This can help identify the source code and environment used for building the image. Example: `app-name-1.2.3-b567-d1234efg`.

## Use Environment and Architecture-Specific Tags

If your application is deployed in different environments (production, staging, development) or has multiple architectures (amd64, arm64), you can use tags that specify these variations. Example: `your-username/app-name:1.2.3-production-amd64`.

## Retag Images When Needed

Sometimes, you may need to retag an image after it has been pushed to the registry. For example, if you have released a patch for your application, you may want to retag the new patched version with the same tag as the previous version. This allows for smoother application updates and less manual work for users who need to apply the patch.

## Use Automated Build and Tagging Tools

Consider using CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitLab CI, Travis-CI) to automate image builds and tagging based on commits, branches, or other rules. This ensures consistency and reduces the likelihood of errors caused by manual intervention.

By following these best practices for image tagging, you can ensure a more organized, maintainable, and user-friendly container registry for your Docker images.

Images categories in HUB:

1. Official images: Images that are officially maintained and supported by the folks at Docker.Are one word long.
2. User images:- Images created and shared by users like you and me.They build on base images and add additional functionality.Are formatted as *user/image-name*
