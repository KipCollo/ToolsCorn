# Docker

Docker is an open source platform that automates deployment, scaling and management of applications by isolating them into lightweight and portable containers.It provides developers and admins with set of tools and APIs to manage containerized apps.You build and package app code, libraries and dependencies into a container image, which can be distributed and run consistently in any environment that support docker

Docker provides tooling and a platform to manage the lifecycle of your containers:

   - Develop your application and its supporting components using containers.
   - The container becomes the unit for distributing and testing your application.
   - When you're ready, deploy your application into your production environment, as a container or an orchestrated service. This works the same whether your production environment is a local data center, a cloud provider, or a hybrid of the two.
