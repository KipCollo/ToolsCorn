Kibana lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic stack.
Kibana is an open source web interface tool for Elasticsearch. We can access it with your browser.Kibana is an excellent tool for visualizing data in the form of charts, graphs, maps, and tables.

We can search logs to check screens for, say, high loads on some of our nodes, or perhaps failed login attempts on SSH. Kibana provides various screens on which we can search, filter, and submit queries as well as view visual aspects, such as traffic peaks on a web site at a given time of day.
