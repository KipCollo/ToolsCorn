Logstash---> Elasticsearch----> Kibana

`Logstash` collects data from the different sources defined by using the configuration file. Logstash can process any type of logs that are being maintained, including Apache logs, MySQL logs, firewall logs, and error logs. The best part is that one can store logs from different nodes and services in a centralized place and analyze them there.

`Elasticsearch` does real-time data analysis from different data sources. It is scalable, and it does full text search.

`Kibana` is a web application designed to visualize data in Elasticsearch. It allows you to search data (in our case, logs) and visualize it in various ways (such as bar graph, pie charts, and other graph types).Visualizations can be organized in dashboards for quick access to information.
