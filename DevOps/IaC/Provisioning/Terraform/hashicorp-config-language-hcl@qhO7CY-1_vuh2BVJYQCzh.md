# HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)

HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) is a configuration language built by HashiCorp that is used for configuring products in the HashiCorp ecosystem. With its human-readable style, HCL is designed to strike a balance between a generic configuration language like JSON or YAML and a high-level scripting language. In relation to the Terraform Roadmap, HCL is the primary language used for writing Terraform configuration files, thus making it a fundamental part of defining and providing data center infrastructure in a descriptive manner.
