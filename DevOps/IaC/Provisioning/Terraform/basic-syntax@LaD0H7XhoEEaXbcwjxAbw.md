# Basic Syntax

The Basic Syntax of HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) includes defining blocks, attributes, and expressions. Blocks are fundamental units like `resource`, `module`, and `provider`, identified by keywords and enclosed in curly braces. Attributes are key-value pairs within blocks, where keys are strings and values can be strings, numbers, or other data types. Expressions allow embedding variables, functions, and references to other resources, enabling dynamic configurations.
