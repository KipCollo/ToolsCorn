# Providers

Terraform Providers are plugins that enable interaction with various external APIs. They manage the lifecycle of resources by defining resource types and data sources. Each provider requires configuration, typically including authentication details and endpoint URLs. Providers are specified in the `provider` block, and multiple providers can be used in a single Terraform project to manage resources across different platforms.
