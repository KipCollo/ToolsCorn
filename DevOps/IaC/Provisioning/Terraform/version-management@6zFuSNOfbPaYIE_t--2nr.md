# Version Management

Version management in Terraform is crucial for maintaining consistency across different environments and team members. Tools like `tfenv` allow developers to easily switch between different versions of Terraform. `tfenv` is a version manager that installs and manages multiple Terraform versions on a single system. It enables teams to specify and use specific Terraform versions for different projects, ensuring compatibility and reproducibility. This tool, along with others like `tfswitch`, helps manage potential conflicts arising from version differences, facilitates easier upgrades, and supports working on multiple projects with varying Terraform version requirements.
