# Provisioning

It is getting and setting the physical components required to run specific applications.

`Terraform`
`Pulumi`:-Pulumi is technologically the most similar to Terraform, the only difference being that itâ€™s not declarative. The Pulumi team considers this an advantage over Terraform, but Terraform also has a cloud development kit (CDK) that allows you to do the same thing.
AWS CloudFormation was the original inspiration behind Terraform, and GCP Deploy-
ment Manager and Azure Resource Manager are cousins. These technologies, while
decent, are neither cloud-agnostic nor open source. They only work for a particular
cloud vendor and tend to be more verbose and less flexible than Terraform.
