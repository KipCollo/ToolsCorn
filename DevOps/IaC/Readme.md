# IaC

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice in DevOps and cloud computing that involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files, rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. This approach allows for version control, automation, and consistency in infrastructure deployment, making it easier to manage, scale, and replicate environments while reducing the risk of human error.

`Infrastructure as code (IaC)` is the process of managing and provisioning computer data center resources through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.The IT infrastructure managed by this process comprises both physical equipment, such as bare-metal servers, as well as virtual machines, and associated configuration resources. The definitions may be in a version control system, rather than maintaining the code through manual processes. The code in the definition files may use either scripts or declarative definitions, but IaC more often employs declarative approaches.

There are generally two approaches to IaC: `declarative (functional)` vs. `imperative (procedural)`. The difference between the declarative and the imperative approach is essentially 'what' versus 'how' . The declarative approach focuses on what the eventual target configuration should be; the imperative focuses on how the infrastructure is to be changed to meet this. The declarative approach defines the desired state and the system executes what needs to happen to achieve that desired state. Imperative defines specific commands that need to be executed in the appropriate order to end with the desired conclusion.

A spotlight is cast on three prominent IaC tools: Terraform, OpenTofu, and AWS CloudFormation. Terraform, with its declarative syntax, is a versatile choice for multi-cloud provisioning. OpenTofu, a truly open source, community-driven, modular, and backwards-compatible tool which is a fork of Terraform showcases both the imperative and declarative approach, allowing users to define the sequence of operations while also specifying the desired end state of the infrastructure. Meanwhile, AWS CloudFormation, deeply integrated with Amazon Web Services, provides native support for orchestrating cloud resources.

## Categories of Infrastructure As Code Tools

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools empower teams to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure, treating it as code. These tools fall into various categories, each catering to specific needs and preferences. Let’s take a look at the categories of IaC tools, along with details and examples.

`Declarative IaC Tools` - Declarative tools focus on describing the desired state of the infrastructure. Users specify what they want, and the tool ensures the system reaches that state.

Examples:

1. Terraform allows users to define infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. It supports various providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, enabling multi-cloud and hybrid cloud scenarios.
2. Pulumi provides Infrastructure as Code in multiple programming languages like Python, TypeScript, and Go. It allows integration with various cloud providers and offers flexibility.
3. SaltStack is an open source platform with YAML configuration files for IaC. It focuses on automation and offers centralized infrastructure management.

`Configuration Management Tools` - These tools focus on configuring and maintaining software applications on existing infrastructure. While not purely IaC, they play a crucial role in managing the software layer.

Examples:

1. Ansible uses declarative YAML scripts to define the desired state of a system. It excels at configuration management, automating repetitive tasks, and can also be used for provisioning infrastructure.
2. Chef uses a Ruby-based domain-specific language (DSL) for writing system configurations. Although it supports a declarative style, the execution of Chef recipes can be seen as imperative because you write code that specifies how to achieve the desired state. It's powerful for managing complex environments and requires a steeper learning curve due to its programming nature.
3. Puppet is a mature configuration management tool that can also be used for IaC. Puppet uses a declarative language called Puppet DSL to define the desired state of your infrastructure. Puppet is a good choice for organizations that need a highly centralized and controlled approach to infrastructure management.

`Container Orchestration Tools` - Container orchestration tools automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. While not traditional IaC, they often integrate IaC principles for infrastructure provisioning.

Examples:

1. Kubernetes manages the deployment and scaling of containerized applications. Tools like Helm provide a way to define and version infrastructure configurations for Kubernetes.
2. Developed by HashiCorp, Nomad excels in managing heterogeneous environments, handling bare metal, VMs, and cloud platforms with equal ease. Its lightweight design and focus on simplicity make it appealing for smaller teams or those seeking a minimalist approach.
3. CloudHedge takes a container-native approach to infrastructure management, offering container-based virtual machines and serverless functions alongside container orchestration. This unique approach can be suitable for organizations looking for a unified platform for infrastructure and application management.

`Cloud Native IaC Tools` - These tools are specifically designed for cloud environments, providing native integrations and optimizations for specific cloud providers.

Examples:

1. Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates are JSON files that define the resources needed for an Azure solution. They are tailored for Azure services and provide a way to automate the deployment and configuration of Azure resources.
2. AWS CloudFormation templates are written in JSON or YAML and specify the resources needed and their configurations. It follows a procedural approach to create, update, or delete resources.

Considerations for Choosing IaC Tools

- Compatibility: Ensure the tool supports the cloud providers and technologies relevant to your infrastructure.
- Community Support: A strong and active community contributes to ongoing development, support, and a wealth of shared knowledge.
- Scalability: The tool should scale with your infrastructure needs, from small projects to large, complex environments.
- Ease of Learning: Consider the learning curve and the team's familiarity with the tool to ensure efficient adoption.
- Security: Assess the security features and best practices supported by the tool to safeguard your infrastructure.

Five Fundamental Features of an IaC Tool - In the dynamic landscape of modern software development, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools have become indispensable for automating and managing infrastructure. Let's dive into five fundamental features that make these tools essential for developers, using straightforward scenarios and relatable examples.

1. Declarative Configuration - Declarative configuration allows users to specify the desired state of their infrastructure without detailing the steps to reach that state. It's like ordering a meal in a restaurant without instructing the chef on how to cook it.
Example: In a declarative IaC tool like Terraform, you describe the infrastructure components you want, such as servers, networks, and databases, in a configuration file. Terraform then takes care of orchestrating the provisioning process.

2. Idempotent Operations - Idempotent operations ensure that applying the same configuration multiple times produces the same result, regardless of the initial or intermediate states. It's like pressing an elevator button – whether it's already lit or not, the elevator will still take you to the desired floor.
Example: Consider an IaC script that defines a virtual machine. Running the script multiple times won't create duplicate machines. Instead, the tool recognizes the existing state and ensures it matches the defined configuration.

3. Version Control Integration - Integration with version control systems allows users to track changes, collaborate, and revert to previous configurations. It's akin to using Git for your code, but now for your infrastructure.
Example: With an IaC tool like Ansible, your infrastructure configurations are stored in version-controlled files. If a change introduces issues, you can roll back to a previous version, just as you would with application code.

4. Dependency Management - Dependency management ensures that components are provisioned in the correct order, respecting dependencies. It's like assembling a puzzle – each piece falls into place at the right time.
Example: In Kubernetes, YAML manifests define resources like pods and services. The tool intelligently manages dependencies, ensuring that services dependent on others are created only after the required resources are in place.

5. Parallel Execution - Parallel execution allows the tool to perform multiple operations simultaneously, enhancing speed and efficiency. Think of it as cooking a multi-course meal where different dishes are prepared concurrently for a faster dining experience.
Example: In AWS CloudFormation, templates can define various resources. The tool analyzes dependencies and provisions independent resources concurrently, reducing the overall time needed to deploy the entire infrastructure.

**Automation Tools** - There are two different categories of automation tools for setting up the infrastructure:- `provisioning tools` and `configuration tools`. Provisioning tools are used to specify and allocate the desired resources. These tools use the dynamic infrastructure platform to implement the allocation. Examples of these tools are Terraform, Openstack Heat and CloudFormation by Amazon. Configuration tools are used to configure and manage the already provisioned resources with the required dependencies and settings. There are plenty of available tools on this category, but the three most popular ones are Puppet, Chef and Ansible.

The most popular vendor specific provisioning tools are CloudFormation for AWS, Cloud Deployment Manager for the Google Cloud Platform and Azure Resource Manager for Microsoft Azure Clouds.
