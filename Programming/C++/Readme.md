# C++

Is an Object Oriented Programming Language, developed by Jarney Stroustrup.Developed from C and SIMULA 67 languages.C++ is the most used and most popular programming language. C++ is a high-level and object-oriented programming language.

C++ is a most popular cross-platform programming language which is used to create high-performance applications and software like OS, Games, E-commerce software, etc. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension of C language. C++ give a high level of control over system resources and memory.


## Comments

Comments in C++ are used to summarize an algorithm, identify a variable’s purpose, or clarify a code segment that appears unclear. Comments are also used for:

1. Comments are used for easier debugging.
2. It makes a program more readable and gives an overall description of the code.
3. Comments are helpful in skipping the execution of some parts of the code.
4. Every time a program or code is reused after long periods of time, the comment recaps all the information of the code quickly.

In C++ there are two types of comments :

1. Single-line comment
2. Multi-line comment

```cpp
// single line comment

/*
multiline comment
*/

```

As a part of the compiler, the Lexical Analyzer scans the characters and transforms them into tokens with no passing of the commented text to the parser. Since Comments do not contribute to the functionality of the program they are simply omitted at the time of compilation.
