# iostream objects

The <iostream> library provides objects which can read user input and output data to the console or to a file.

A list of all iostream objects can be found in the table below:

- **cerr** 	An output stream for error messages
- **clog** 	An output stream to log program information
- **cin**	An input stream that reads keyboard input from the console by default
- **cout** 	An output stream which writes output to the console by default
- **wcerr** The same as cerr but outputs wide char (wchar_t) data rather than char data
- **wclog** The same as clog but outputs wide char (wchar_t) data rather than char data
- **wcin** 	The same as cin but interprets each input character as a wide char (wchar_t)
- **wcout** The same as cout but outputs wide char (wchar_t) data rather than char data
