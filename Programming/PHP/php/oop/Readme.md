# OOP

PHP includes a complete object model. Some of its features are: visibility, abstract and final classes and methods, additional magic methods, interfaces, and cloning.

PHP treats objects in the same way as references or handles, meaning that each variable contains an object reference rather than a copy of the entire object.
