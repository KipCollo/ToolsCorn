As developers, we’re not just writing code on a text editor without any other external help. Whether we realize it or not, we’re constantly using different development tools to improve the way we work and the speed at which we can deliver our code.

In this article, we’ll cover 25 backend development tools that are crucial in the web development industry, and as a [backend developer](/backend), you should be aware of them.

The categories we’ll tackle are:

- IDEs and editors
- Database tools
- Collaboration
- Hosting Services
- API-Related tools
- Productivity tools

So let’s get started!

## Beyond programming languages: IDEs and Editors

Other than the actual programming languages, the Integrated Development Environment (A.K.A your IDE) is the single most important tool you’ll have to pick and use throughout your career in software development.

Some of them are generic (as in, they work for all types of development), and others will have specific backend development tools (which is what we’re focusing on right now).

Let’s see some examples that are great for a web development project.

### 1. Jetbrains Products

The [Jetbrains family](https://www.jetbrains.com/) of IDEs targets multiple programming languages, including JavaScript, .NET, JAVA (and the Java Virtual Machine), Python, PHP, and more (mostly great options for web development).

![Jetbrains code editor](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/jetbrains-code-editor-z7z1t.png)

The benefit of using these IDEs, in comparison with others, is that given how they’re language/technology specific, they have tools designed for those programming languages and specifically for this list to help in your backend development tasks, such as:

- Debuggers.
- Improved IntelliSense.
- Improved development environment.

The only minor issue with these IDEs, especially when compared to the rest of the options listed here, is that they’re not all free. While not all of them are priced the same, I recommend you check out your IDE’s pricing page to understand what options you have (there are free plans if you qualify for them).

### 2. Visual Studio Code

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is definitely one of the most popular alternatives these days for all types of web developers, but definitely for backend developers. This IDE’s strongest selling point is that it’s incredibly extensible through plugins. And the community using it is so big and varied that there are plugins for literally anything you need.

![VSCode code editor](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/vscode-code-editor-8pznw.png)

The other major benefit of VSCode over JetBrains products is that it gives developers a fully working IDE for FREE. While some of the extensions don’t provide exactly the same developer experience as a JetBrains IDE, the proper combination of extensions can provide a very close alternative through VSCode.

### 3. Zed

[Zed](https://zed.dev/) is a different type of code editor, and because of that, it might just be the right one for you.

![Zed code editor](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/zed-code-editor-7ovxz.png)

Zed, like VSCode, is an all-purpose code editor, letting you code in whatever language you want (whether you’re doing web development or not). The main reasons why you’d pick Zed over others are:

- **Improved performance.** Zed takes advantage of your CPU AND GPU to improve the speed at which the IDE responds to your commands.
- **Multi-user support.**
- **Team features.** Zed lets you build software while working with others by sharing notes and letting you interact with teammates through the IDE.

Zed is an [open-source project](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed), but at the time of writing this article, it’s only available for macOS, so Linux and Windows users are still unable to try this excellent option.

### 4. Sublime Text

Before VSCode, [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) was probably one of the most popular code editors for web developers who wanted something powerful for free.

Just like VSCode, Sublime supports extensibility through plugins, and the rich ecosystem of plugins makes it quite a versatile editor. As a note, this code editor also supports GPU rendering of the UI, like Zed does, so if performance is important to you, then you’ll want to keep reading.

![Sublime code editor](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/sublime-text-code-editor-ngtnf.png)

With a refreshed UI (if you’ve used Sublime Text in the past, you’ll be happily surprised!) and better internal tooling, the latest version of this editor (version 4) is trying to regain the portion of the market that VSCode took from it at the time.

### 5. VIM - a developer-focused editor

[VIM](https://www.vim.org/) is a tool that you either hate or love as a developer, but there is no middle ground.

This is such an iconic text editor that all the previously mentioned IDE have what is called a “vim mode,” which allows you to use them as if you were using VIM (with the visual and input modes).

![Vim code editor](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/vim-code-editor-ohiyc.png)

Vim lets you write code without having to move your fingers away from the home row (the row where you “rest” your fingers, the one with the F and G keys). That means you can navigate documents, write code, move through projects, and more, all with minimum hand movement.

This is the key philosophy behind Vim’s design, and if you embrace it, it should help to make you a very proficient developer. Of course, adapting to this way of working is not trivial, and there is a lot of muscle memory that has to be re-trained. But once you do it, it’s really hard to go back.

Just like with all the generic IDEs here, you’ll have to [customize it through “scripts”](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script_search_results.php?order_by=creation_date&direction=descending) to make it work exactly as you want for your environment.

## Database Tools

While doing backend development, you will definitely be interacting with databases. They’re a ubiquitous backend tool in the realm of web development.

Let’s take a look at some great database tools you can use as a backend developer to interact with your favorite database management systems (DBMS).

### 6. DataGrip

[Datagrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/) is a JetBrains product, which makes it a great option if you’re also going with a JetBrains IDE.

This tool lets you access all SQL databases from within the same user interface, it provides great help while browsing the data stored in the database, and it also has features that help you write better SQL queries.

![DataGrip database explorer](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/datagrip-database-explorer-l8987.png)

While the pricing of these tools might be a bit steep (especially if you go with the IDE as well), it’s definitely a solid option if you’re looking for feature-rich and stable software development tools.

### 7. Navicat

[Navicat](https://navicat.com/en/products) actually has a family of alternatives based on what you need, from the standard set of SQL databases (such as MySQL, Oracle, Postgre, and so on) up to other NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Redis.

In general, the Navicat alternatives are quite lightweight and powerful to use. They might not be as feature-rich as Datagrip, but they let you easily browse and query the data you need.

![Navicat database explorer](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/navicat-database-explorer-r1unn.png)

The free trial for Navicat only lasts 14 days, and then you’ll have to pay a monthly fee. That said, for non-commercial use, the license is quite low, which makes it accessible to almost all developers.

As for features, it has all the ones you’d expect from a tool like this:

- Ability to connect to multiple databases and visually browse their content.
- Query editor with some IntelliSense built-in.
- Model representation (automatically converts a database into ER Diagrams).
- Simple object designer to create entities through a visual IDE.

The Navicat series of apps are great backend tools to have at your disposal, if you don’t mind their price, that is.

### 8. TablePlus

[Tableplus](https://tableplus.com/) is very similar to Navicat in the sense that it’s another lightweight database manager. The main differences are:

- Tableplus only supports SQL-based databases.
- The pricing model is simpler, by only charging a one-time license without you having to commit to a monthly subscription.

![TablePlus database manager](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/tableplus-database-manager-06d09.png)

Some of the most relevant features of Tableplus are:

- Inline data editing.
- Advanced filtering lets you combine different filtering conditions when searching.
- Code auto-complete, which comes in very handy when writing SQL queries.
- Extensible through JavaScript plugins (currently in Beta).

This is a solid backend tool alternative to any of the previous options and with a simpler price tag.

### 9. DBeaver

[DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) is a free, cross-platform tool that lets you connect and interact with multiple databases. While there is a PRO version with extra features, the free version is more than powerful enough to get you started with almost any database you can think of, both SQL and NoSQL alike.

For a full list of supported databases on the free version, check out their [about page](https://dbeaver.io/about/).

![DBeaver database manager](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/dbeaver-database-manager-fvlrd.png)

Some of the major features of DBeaver are:

- SQL editor with completion.
- ER-diagram creation from a table definition.
- In-line data editing.

Task management to kill any long-lasting queries that block your database.

## Collaboration tools for web development

Unless you’re working as a solo-dev (and even then!), collaboration tools allow you to coordinate your work and understand who’s working on what and what you should be working on next.

While these might not be considered “backend tools” per se, they definitely help improve your performance and organization, so we can still call them “development tools” as a broader term.

### 10. Trello

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a very simple yet powerful organizational tool that lets teams build a Kanban-like board with clear states and simple UX (drag&drop is king in Trello).

Setting up a new project and a team takes minutes in Trello, and through the plugin system, you can get extra features such as date reminders, calendar integrations, and more.

![Trello board](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/trello-board-o0i4i.png)

The simple UI and intuitive UX make Trello one of the best options out there for collaborative tools as long as the needs of the team are met with simple column-based layouts and minimal information.

### 11. Monday

[Monday](https://monday.com/) is a relatively new online platform for project management and collaboration. I say “new” because some of the other alternatives here have been around for over 5+ years.

Their limited free plan lasts forever, so if you have a small team and limited requirements, this might just be the perfect tool for you. Also, if you actually need to pay, Monday’s plans are accessible, especially when compared to other alternatives.

![Monday project management tool](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/monday-project-management-tool-xws17.png)

Monday’s fully customizable UI lets you build the collaborative environment you need. This is a huge advantage over others who've been around for longer and have a fixed UI that you have to adapt to.

### 12. Basecamp

[Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) is a mix between Trello, Monday, and Notion in the sense that it tries to provide developers with the best and most relevant tools from those worlds, leaving out the ones that just create “noise.”

![Basecamp project management tool](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/basecamp-project-management-tool-2pusd.png)

Basecamp’s philosophy is to keep things simple and only focus on the features that truly add to collaboration:

- Simple card tables like Trello.
- Ability to upload and manage documents and files with your team.
- Integrated chat.
- Message boards to send notifications to everyone.

The only “downside” to basecamp, if you will, is that there is no “forever free” plan. Both their plans are paid and have a 30-day free trial, so you can definitely give it a shot and figure out if what they offer is enough for your needs.

### 13. Wrike

[Wrike](https://www.wrike.com/) is yet another attempt at making project management and collaboration feel organic and seamless. They have a minimalistic UI and provide you with over 400 integrations to create your own workflows based on your needs and current ecosystem.

They have a free plan that, while feature-limited, it’s perfect for understanding the basic way of using Wrike and how useful it can be to you in your current project.

![Wrike project management tool](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/wrike-project-management-tool-5g3kl.png)

Their innovative use of AI allows you to create content faster, analyze project and task descriptions, and create subtasks based on it.

Wrike feels efficient and powerful, even for its free plan. Give it a chance if you’re a freelancer or if you have a small team looking for something new and powerful.

## Hosting Services

When it comes to backend development, deploying your code and running it on the cloud will be a common thing; this is a practice known as continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). While in some situations, you’ll be dealing with a custom, in-house infrastructure, there are platforms that will make the entire process very lightweight (as in deploying with a couple of clicks).

Let’s take a look at some of the most common alternatives!

### 14. Railway

[Railway.app](https://railway.app/) aims at giving developers all the tools they need at a click’s distance. We’re talking about:

- PR-triggered deployments.
- Support for all popular programming languages.
- Autoscaling.
- Load balancing.
- Monitoring.
- A great uptime (99.95%)
- With more than 200 ready-made templates for you to get going.

![Railway hosting](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/railway-hosting-j8me8.png)

Railway has no free plan, but their basic one is very accessible. Careful though, they also charge per resource utilization. Lucky for you, they have a [very handy consumption calculator](https://railway.app/pricing) to avoid surprises at the end of the month!

### 15. Heroku

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is another Platform as a Service provider. This one provides the basic services most of them do, such as autoscaling, monitoring, GitHub integration, and more.

The list of supported programming languages is not huge, but the most common ones are definitely covered: Node.js, Ruby, JAVA, PHP, Python, Go, Scala, and even Clojure.

![Heroku hosting](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/heroku-hosting-2u6bz.png)

Another great selling point for Heroku is that on top of their infrastructure, they also offer a managed Postgre database as a service and a Redis one. In both situations, you’ll have to pay for the services as you use them, so keep that in mind.

### 16. Digital Ocean

As opposed to platforms such as Heroku, [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) is known as an Infrastructure as a Service provider (IaaS). They give you all the servers you need and all the resources (memory, CPU, etc) you want to pay for. However, setting up your deployment process, automating your integration tests, or even having all the required libraries to run your code is up to you.

This is by no means something bad, some teams do prefer to have that freedom over other platforms like Railway and Heroku, where everything’s already managed.

![Digital Ocean hosting](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/digital-ocean-hosting-i7a9c.png)

Large-scale applications will usually require to have custom infrastructure that managed services can hardly provide. This is where IaaS providers come in.

On top of their basic offering, they do offer managed databases such as MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, and others.

### 17. Hetzner

[Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) is yet another IaaS that offers everything you need to get going if you know what to do with it. In other words, they offer all the hardware you might dream of, even in the cloud, but you have to configure it and maintain it.

Their only “managed” offer is for web hosting though, so if you’re looking to host your website or app and you don’t want to have to deal with server maintenance and configuration, then this is a good option for you.

![Hetzner hosting](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/hetzner-hosting-oupq8.jpg)

Other than that, their offering is quite standard, although their pricing model might not be. While they do have the standard pricing tiers like the rest of them, they also give you the option to “bid” for used hardware that is no longer needed.

### 18. Vercel

If you’re building a NextJS application and you’re looking for a quick way to deploy it, then there is probably no better place than [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (the owner of NextJS).

Their platform allows you to link your GitHub account to their systems and deploy your entire application with a single push to the repo.

![Vercel hosting](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/vercel-hosting-9jvk9.png)

And since they’re experts on NextJS, your app will “just work.”

Even their free plan is perfect for quick SaaS prototypes and small applications. On top of this, they offer monitoring, auto-scaling, load balancing, and everything you’d expect from a PaaS provider.

While it’s true they don’t support other technologies or even offer other related services, such as managed databases, there is hardly anyone who can provide a better developer experience when it comes to deploying a NextJS application.

### 19. Render

You can think of [Render](https://render.com/) as if Vercel and Heroku had a love child. Render gives you the amazing developer experience provided by Vercel but the flexibility (or more) from Heroku.

You’re not tied to a single technology; instead, you have all the major runtimes available out of the box. Much higher HTTP timeouts (up to 100 minutes, which is incredible compared to the standard 10 or 30 seconds most providers give you) and tons of other security and quality-of-life improvements.

![Render hosting](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/render-hosting-w4urq.png)

Render also offers managed MySQL and managed Redis instances for you to use, even in their free tier. In the end, unless you’ve been using Heroku for a while and you’re happy with their DX, it might be a good idea to check out Render instead.

### 20. OVHCloud

[OVHCloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com/) is an all-in-one solution that seems to provide you with everything you need, from “bare metal” (as in infrastructure) to managed hosting for web applications, managed databases (they have many to choose from), and many other services.

However, they do not seem to offer quality-of-life integrations to make your deployment workflow simple and intuitive.

![OVHCloud hosting](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/ovhcloud-hosting-ncfch.png)

Now, given how they centralize all related services from domain name registration all the way up to analytics, identity management, file storage (CDN), and even one-click install CMS (content management systems, such as WordPress), etc, it might just be a good option for you. That is if you have the expertise in your team to deal with all these options.

## API-Related Tools

As backend developers, we’ll always be dealing with APIs (Application Programming Interface), either through using the ones created by others or writing our own.

Whatever you’re doing, it’s always good to have some backend tools to help you build and test them faster, so let’s take a look at a few options.

### 21. Swagger

Some developers would argue that one of the hardest parts of creating an API is documenting it. Not only because it might sound like a boring task, but explaining what the API endpoint is doing well enough is not trivial.

That’s where [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) comes into play.

![Swagger API tool](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/swagger-api-tool-vngxu.png)

This tool allows you to create interactive documentation that provides developers with all they need to understand how to use your endpoints, and at the same time, it also gives them the option to test them directly from the generated UI.

### 22. Postman

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is less of a documentation-only app and has grown over the years to become a testing API tool that every developer and development team should know about. Backend developers are especially benefited from using Postman because of how well it helps organize and manage APIs.

With Postman, you can organize all your company’s APIs, share them with the associated dev teams, and let them use and interact with them without having to write a single line of code.

![Postman documentation tool](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/postman-documentation-tool-cl81q.png)

While Swagger is more of a development tool that every backend developer should know about, Postman is the tool that every development team should use to share & control internal API access and documentation.

## Productivity

Finally, the last category is about productivity. While some of the products and services mentioned already do provide productivity enhancements, they weren’t there for that. The following list of backend tools is created thinking only about the benefits they can bring to your productivity while working as a backend developer.

### 23. iTerm

If you’re a macOS user, then [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/) is definitely one of the “must haves” you need to look into. As a backend developer, you’ll spend a lot of your day in the terminal.

![iTerm terminal developer tool](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/iterm-terminal-developer-tool-zze25.png)

iTerm will take that experience to the next level by bringing in features such as:

- Parallel panes inside the same window making it easy to multi-task.
- Improved auto-complete
- In-window search outside of the current program you’re using.
- Instant replay lets you review the latest content on the screen before cleaning it.
- Paste history, letting you move through the latest pasted content into the terminal.

Mind you, none of these features are mandatory; you can easily work without them, but they do improve your quality of life as a developer. Hence the reason why iTerm leads this list.

### 24. Zsh/OhMyZsh

The combination of these two gives your terminal superpowers. [Zsh](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/) is an improved shell that lets you work much faster and more efficiently if you’re spending several hours typing commands in your terminal. For example, you get features such as:

- Advanced tab auto-complete
- Extensibility
- Spelling corrections
- And more.

![Oh my Zsh shell](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/zsh-shell-ui-6s163.png)

As mentioned above, after you have your ZSH installed and set up, you should look into installing oh-my-zsh, which helps with configuring all the customization options you have on this shell:

- It comes bundled with [over 300 plugins](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins), ranging from 1password integrations to the “jump” plugin, which lets you move around the filesystem by moving from mark to mark (you can assign marks to folders).
- [Plenty of themes](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes) out of the box.

If you find yourself spending hours on the terminal, consider installing this combo.

### 25. Raycast

[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) allows you to improve your productivity by giving you a better application launcher. Instead of using the default launcher, you can replace it with Raycast and gain superpowers.

Now, you suddenly have access to hundreds of [community-created extensions](https://www.raycast.com/store) that allow you to directly interact with chatGPT from the app launcher, use GitHub, interact with VSCode directly, and more.

![Raycast app launcher](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/raycast-app-launcher-w5rg3.png)

While it is only available for macOS users, Raycast has become a must-have application for backend developers on this platform. In the end, the faster you can reach for your tools, the more productive you become. And a properly configured Raycast can make your web development process feel like a breeze.

Whether your goal is to become a backend developer or to stay relevant as one, the goal itself requires adopting an eternal student mindset. The ever-evolving web development space demands continuous learning, regardless of the programming language you use. New frameworks, libraries, and methodologies emerge regularly, offering different solutions to old problems. To remain relevant as a [backend developer](/backend), you’ll have to stay updated by honing your core skills.

In this article, we’ll cover the following set of backend developer skills we recommend you aim for:

- Keeping an eye on core and new backend programming languages
- Understanding the basics of software design and architecture
- Understanding databases and how to use them
- API development
- The basics of version control
- Testing and debugging
- CI/CD and DevOps fundamentals
- Soft skills

So, let's get going!

## Understanding Backend Development

Before we move on and start discussing the different backend development skills you should focus on, let’s first understand what a backend developer is. After all, if you’re looking to actually become a backend developer, you’ll need this.

A backend developer focuses entirely on writing business logic for an application and much of the supporting logic as well.

That said, there might be applications where the business logic is split into the frontend and the backend. However, while the frontend dev might have to share their time between UI code and business logic, the backend dev will focus most of their time on core business logic. That’s the main difference between the two.

![UI vs Backend](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/6529303b545cb53d4aa730ca_1709056806118.png)

In the above image, you can see how there is a lot more behind the curtain than just the UI when it comes to web applications. In this case, a “simple” log-in form needs a backend to contain its core business logic.

Let’s now look at the most in-demand backend developer skills you should focus on in backend development.

## Proficiency in Core and Emerging Programming Languages

One of the most basic skills you should focus on as a backend developer is on identifying key programming languages to learn (or at least keep an eye out for).

There are some essential backend languages that the industry has adopted as de facto standards. This means most new projects are usually coded using one (or multiple) of these programming languages.

![core-languages](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/6529303b545cb53d4aa730ca_1709058292005.png)

The most common names you should look out for are:

- **JavaScript (or any of its variants, such as TypeScript).** This is a very common option because it’s also the language used by frontend developers, thus making it easier for developers to work on both sides of the same project.
- **Python.** While a very common option for other types of projects (such as data processing and [data science](https://roadmap.sh/ai-data-scientist)), it’s still very popular in the web development world. Python has many good qualities and supporting frameworks that make it a very easy-to-pick-up option for coding backend systems.
- **Go (A.K.A Golang).** This programming language was developed by Google. It was designed with simplicity, efficiency, and concurrency in mind. That’s made it gain popularity in the backend development space, making it an interesting option for projects that prioritize performance and concurrency.
- **Java.** One of the most common alternatives for enterprise solutions, Java, has been constantly evolving since its first release back in 1995. All that time making its way into big enterprises that trust its robustness and ever-growing community of developers. While not the easiest language to learn, it’s definitely up there in the top 10 most popular [backend languages](https://roadmap.sh/backend/languages) (according to [StackOverflow’s 2023 Developer survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#technology-most-popular-technologies)).

While there are other options, the ones mentioned above, from the backend point of view, are some of the most relevant languages to pay attention to. Here are the top 10 most popular ones amongst professional developers (screenshot taken from SO’s survey of 2023):

![Stackoverflow Survey Result](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/6529303b545cb53d4aa730ca_1709057007054.png)

### Keeping an eye on the rising stars

If working with at least one of the most common backend languages was important, understanding what are the rising technologies in the backend world is just as crucial.

You won’t see a new programming language being released every month. However, in the span of a few years, you might see the release of several, and out of those, some might stick long enough to become new standards.

For example, take a look at the period between 2012 and 2015; in just 3 years, 9 programming languages were released, out of which most of them are being used to this day.

![Famous Languages](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/6529303b545cb53d4aa730ca_1709058257292.png)

- In 2012, we got Julia, Elm, Go, and TypeScript.
- In 2013, we got Dart
- In 2014, we got Swift, Hack, and Crystal
- And in 2015, we got Rust.

Some of those languages are very relevant to this day, such as TypeScript and Rust, while others, such as Hack and Crystal, might be known to only a few in very niche sectors.

Of course, it’s impossible to predict which programming language will become a standard. However, the skill that you need to hone is that of keeping an eye on the industry to spot new and emerging trends.

### The importance of supporting frameworks

Frameworks for a specific programming language do change a lot faster than the language itself, though.

Frameworks are there to provide you with a simplified gateway into the functionalities that you’d normally need for common tasks. For example, in the context of backend web development, frameworks usually take care of:

- **Parsing HTTP requests** and turning them into objects you can easily interact with (so you don’t have to learn how the HTTP protocol works).
- **Abstracting concepts,** such as a request or a response, into objects and functions that you can reason about at a higher level. This gives you an easier time thinking about how to solve a problem using these tools.
- **Accessing data becomes a lot easier when there are abstractions.** Some frameworks provide what is known as an ORM (Object Relational Mapping). Through ORM, you can interact with databases without having to think about writing SQL queries or even database schemas.
- And many more.

Frameworks are an essential aspect of the work you’ll do as a backend developer, which is why you should not neglect them. Of course, learning and mastering every single framework out there is impossible. Instead, learn to keep an eye out in the industry and see what are the most common frameworks, and focus on one (or two) of them.

## Software Design and Architecture

Coding is not just about writing code.

While that statement might be a bit confusing, the truth is there is a lot of architecture involved in software development (both in frontend and backend development). Sometimes, working on these aspects of a system is the job of a specific role called “architect.” However, for backend systems, it’s not uncommon for backend developers to also be involved in architecture conversations and decisions. You’re helping design the underlying backend infrastructure, after all.

The following diagram shows an example of what a very simple system’s architecture might look like:

![Simple System Architecture](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/6529303b545cb53d4aa730ca_1709057266440.png)

While the example is oversimplified, it gives you an idea of what the practice of “architecting a system” is.

Essentially, architecting a system means coming up with concepts that represent different aspects of the solution and then deciding how you want to make them interact with each other.

Why is architecture so important here? Because it gives you properties such as code encapsulation, separation of concerns, reusability, and even scalability as a byproduct of the architecture itself.

Let’s take a quick look at some of the most common architectures used for creating backend systems.

### Most common backend architectures

There are too many different architectural styles and patterns to cover them all inside a single article, but let's just look at some of the most common ones and how they can help you while working on your backend system.

- **Monolithic architecture:** In a monolithic architecture, the entire application is built as a single, tightly coupled unit. All components (frontend, backend, database, etc) are part of the same codebase. This is a great first architecture because it feels very natural to develop under, and if your project is not going to grow out of proportion, then you will probably not hit any of the cons.
- **Microservice-based architecture:** The application is divided into small, independent services, each responsible for a specific business capability. These services communicate through APIs.
- **Service-Oriented Architecture:** Similar to microservices, a service-oriented architecture splits functionality into individual services. The main difference is that these services aren’t as granular as a microservice, so they might incorporate functionalities related to different business entities.
- **Event-driven architecture:** With this architecture, each system (or service) responds to events (e.g., user actions and messages from other services) by triggering actions or processes. All services communicate with each other indirectly through an event bus (also known as a “message bus”), so it removes the possibility of having two or more services coupled with each other (meaning that they can’t be treated individually).
- **Serverless Architecture:** Also known as Function as a Service (FaaS), serverless architecture allows you to focus on writing code without worrying about the server where they’ll run. Functions are executed in response to events without the need for provisioning or managing servers (this is done FOR you automatically).
- **Microkernel architecture:** This architecture lets you build the core, essential functionality into a small microkernel and have the rest of the features built as plugins that can be added, removed or exchanged easily.

And if you want to know more about the patterns and principles mentioned here, please check out the [Software Design and Architecture roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/software-design-architecture).

## Mastery of Database Management Systems

As a backend developer, you will undoubtedly have to deal with database administration in your daily tasks. They are the industry standard for storing persistent data.

Because of that, it’s important to understand that you should be aware of two main categories of databases: SQL databases and NoSQL databases.

### SQL databases

These are the standard structured databases (A.K.A relational databases) where you need to define the schema for your data (essentially the data structures you’re dealing with), and then you’ll use a language called [SQL (Structured Query Language)](https://roadmap.sh/sql) to interact with the data inside it. Most backend developers will interact with SQL databases at some point in their career, as this is the most common type of database.

### NoSQL databases

As the name implies, these are not your standard SQL databases; in fact, within this category, there are columnar databases, document-based ones (such as MongoDB), key-value-based ones (like Redis), and more. They don’t use predefined data structures, giving you more flexibility and control over what you can store and how you store it. Backend developers will deal with only a handful of these, as there are many different sub-types, and more are created every year.

Some examples of these databases are:

- MongoDB, a document-based database (see here a mongoDB roadmap if you’re interested).
- Redis, an in-memory key-value pair database.
- Neo4J, a graph database.
- ElasticSearch, a document-based search engine.

In the end, the decision between SQL and NoSQL is about trade-offs and figuring out what works best for your particular use case.

## API Development Capabilities

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are everywhere. They power the backend of almost all major systems out there (according to a [study conducted by O’Reilly in 2020](https://www.oreilly.com/pub/pr/3307), 77% of companies were using microservices/APIs).

That is to say, if you’re thinking about becoming a backend developer, you will be coding APIs/microservices. This is why understanding the basics of them is crucial to ensuring your relevance in the field.

![System vs External System](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/6529303b545cb53d4aa730ca_1709057608824.png)

The above diagram explains how APIs interact with whatever you might be building.

Now, if you’re inside the “**The System**” box, then you need to understand how to interact with these APIs using the right tools. If you’re inside the “**External System**” box, then you need to understand the type of standards these APIs need to follow and how to implement them.

Don’t worry though, for both situations, there are always frameworks and libraries you can use to simplify your task and ensure you’re following the proper industry standards.

### What are the most common API types?

The most common types of APIs used in the industry currently are REST and GraphQL.

As a backend developer, it’s not mandatory that you master both of these types, but it’s definitely recommended that you have some practical experience with one of them.

- **RESTful APIs.** These are APIs that work over HTTP and make extensive use of the HTTP Verbs to give meaning to each request. They’ve been the most popular type of API until recently, so there are still a lot of projects and teams that make use of it.
- **GraphQL.** GraphQL APIs operate over HTTP as well, leveraging the HTTP protocol and its verbs. In contrast to the conventional RESTful APIs, GraphQL has emerged as a powerful alternative, offering a flexible and efficient approach to data querying and manipulation. GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, providing a more tailored and efficient interaction between clients and servers.

Is there one better than the other? There is no easy way to answer that question as both are capable of doing everything you’d need. It’s more about your particular requirements and the preferences of your dev team.

## Version Control Savvy

One mandatory skill that all backend developers should work on (actually, all developers, in general) is version control, or in other words, understanding and being familiar with version control systems.

Essentially, you’ll want to know how to use the version control tool that everyone else is using. The industry standard at the moment of writing this is [Git](https://git-scm.com/), while there might be some teams using other (older) tools, as long as you understand the current one, you’ll be in good shape.

### What is version control?

Version control references the ability for you and other developers to share code with each other while you’re working on the same files.

While Git is the industry standard at the moment, GitHub has created such a popular platform around Git, that it almost makes it mandatory to learn about.

So go ahead and create an account, browse what others are doing, and upload your own personal projects. It’s definitely a great way to learn.

### What should you learn about Git?

If you’re picking up Git as your version control system of choice, there are two main areas you should be focusing on.

- **The basics.** Clearly understanding how Git works and the basic commands to add, push and pull changes. You should aim to learn enough about them to feel comfortable using them on your day-to-day (because you will).
- **Branching strategies.** Sadly, using Git alone is not enough. While through Git you can already start versioning your code, when the project is complex enough and your team big enough, the tool alone will not be enough. You’ll have to come up with [branching strategies](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=es_ES) to organize the whole team’s workflow.

Keep in mind that Git and Git branching are not trivial topics, and they’ll take a while to master. So, while you should give yourself time to learn about them, also make sure you check with others (or use tools such as ChatGPT) to validate your commands before using them. Remember, a wrong Git command or a wrong workflow can cause major problems within a project, especially if there are many developers working on the same codebase.

## Testing

Understanding both what testing is and the importance of it within the backend development workflow is crucial for all developers, and one of the mandatory backend developer skills to focus on.

Testing is the development process of making sure your code works in a way that doesn’t involve you manually testing every feature but rather using tools that allow you to test and reproduce any problems that can be found programmatically.

This, of course, helps to remove potential human error from the equation when testing big systems and to increase the speed at which these tests can be done (think seconds vs hours of you doing it manually).

Testing is a far more complex discipline than I can describe here. Just know that there are many different ways to test a system, and all backend developers should be aware of the following:

- **Unit testing:** This is the most common way of doing code testing. You’ll write tests using a testing framework for every publicly available function/method in your code. This way you’re making sure every piece of code that can be used is tested and performs according to plan. Running these tests is usually quite fast, so you’ll be doing it before every commit (usually).
- **Integration testing:** If you’re building a system that consists of multiple independent systems working together (think, for instance, a microservice-based architecture), then testing each individual part is not enough. You also have to make sure systems that should interact with each other do so correctly. This is where integration tests come into play.
- **End-to-end testing (E2E):** These tests are similar to integration tests, but they also include the UI of the system. There are tools you can use to automate actions in your UI as if a real user were performing them and then checking the result. For example, clicking on a log-out button and checking if you’re later redirected to the log-in screen. This flow would involve the backend performing some actions that result in the user being logged out.
- **Load testing:** While not exactly the same process as with the previous test types, load testing is great for backend systems because it helps you determine if your backend is ready to deal with high amounts of traffic.

You can think of the list in graphical format as the following diagram:

![Testing types](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/6529303b545cb53d4aa730ca_1709057834295.png)

If you’re just getting started with testing, I’d recommend focusing only on unit testing for the time being. Once you have a grasp on it, start moving out following the above diagram and slowly move into the other types as you progress.

## CI/CD and DevOps Familiarity

As a backend developer, your code will be constantly deployed, either into cloud environments or perhaps even into normal, on-premise servers. The point is that what you build will run through CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) processes.

![ci-cd](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/6529303b545cb53d4aa730ca_1709058122541.png)

These processes will automatically test it (Continuous Integration) and automatically deploy it (if all tests go well). As a backend developer, you’re not usually expected to know and understand how to configure these processes; however, it’s important that you know about them.

DevOps is yet another tangential area to that of a backend developer. When teams are small enough, backend devs might be “gently pushed” into tasks such as configuring CI/CD pipelines, setting up servers, and more. These tasks are usually performed by dedicated professionals with the role of DevOps. Their specialty is automation, making the deployment process efficient and ensuring that everything runs smoothly in the real-world server environment. They play a crucial role in maintaining the reliability and performance of applications and websites.

So, while they’re not strictly the responsibilities of backend developers, they’re close enough to the role’s day-to-day that it would be a good idea to learn about them. If you’re interested in learning more about DevOps, check out [our DevOps roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops) containing all the key topics you should learn about if you want to become a DevOps engineer.

## Soft Skills

Finally, the last set of backend developer skills you should focus on are, actually, not technical skills, nor are they exclusively useful for backend developers. These are skills that every developer should work on during their career: soft skills.

### Improving communication

The ability to communicate with others, both technical and non-technical people, is crucial in any developer's career.

For backend developers, it’s especially important because communicating their work and the effects of it is definitely harder than other roles, such as frontend developers who can actually showcase what they’re building.

As a backend developer, you’ll be able to better explain problems or blockers to your colleagues, you’ll be able to perform requirement gathering much more effectively, and you’ll even improve your own problem-solving skills by being better at articulating the problems and potential solutions to yourself.

### Critical thinking

Honing your critical thinking as a backend developer will help your ability to analyze complex problems, identify patterns much faster, and come up with innovative solutions to the problems you’re facing.

Pushing the limits of your critical thinking skills will also foster a more systematic and strategic approach to coding and architecting robust and efficient solutions.

In other words, it’ll make you a better and more efficient coder. And who doesn’t want that?

## Conclusion

To summarize, if you expect to become a backend developer or to grow in the area of backend development:

- Keep an eye on the industry to understand what’s the status quo and what’s new and hot.
- Understand the basics of software design and architecture.
- Look into relational databases and NoSQL databases as well; they’re both important.
- Learn how to build and use APIs; they’ll be part of almost every project you work on.
- Remember, testing might look like it’s not mandatory, but it’s definitely a standard practice when it comes to backend development.
- CI/CD and DevOps are practices you’ll be involved with, either directly or indirectly, so learn about them.
- Soft skills are just as important as technical skills if you expect to grow in your career.

That said, do not take this list as the ultimate roadmap but rather as a starting point. If you’re willing to take your backend developer career to the next level, push yourself out of your comfort zone and pursue the skills listed here and the ones listed in this detailed [backend development roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend).

Remember, constant learning is the only absolute truth in the software development world (this is true for backend developers, too). If you keep your skillset updated with the latest trends, you’ll remain adaptable and effective as a backend developer.

Web development is typically divided into two main categories: [backend development](https://roadmap.sh/backend) and [frontend development](https://roadmap.sh/frontend). Frontend development focuses on the visible part of the application for end-users, i.e. the part that users interact with, while backend development involves writing code that remains unseen but is essential for the functioning of all applications—the business logic.

Two of the key components when it comes to backend development are the programming language that you are going to code in and the database. In this article, we will be looking into a subset of programming languages that could be used for backend development. We will be discussing the pros and cons of each and the community to help you pick the best programming language for backend development.

Diving straight in, I will cover the top 5 backend programming languages that you should to learn if you’re looking to broaden your horizons in the server-side world.

## Top 5 Backend Languages to Learn for Web Development

The best backend languages to learn in 2024 are:

- Python
- Java
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Go

Why these languages specifically?

They’re some of the most known and used languages in the industry right now (see [StackOverflow’s 2023 Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#most-popular-technologies-language-prof)). That said, keep in mind that these are all great options, and they’re not presented here in any particular order.

### Python

Python has been around for decades already and while it’s never been the most popular option, it has always managed to stay within the top 5 choices. People love it for being easy to read, straightforward, and able to handle all sorts of tasks, making it a top pick for developers globally. Sure, Python's got a big name in data processing and machine learning, but let's not forget its solid impact on web development!.

What makes Python extra appealing, especially for beginners, is the fact that reading and writing it feels very much like English (or at least, as pseudo code). This makes it a top choice for folks just starting out in coding.

#### Beginner Accessibility and Learning Resources

One of Python's standout features is its beginner-friendly syntax, making it an ideal language for those new to programming. The emphasis on readability and the absence of complex syntax (for the most part), eases the learning curve, enabling new developers to quickly grasp fundamental concepts.

Python's community plays a critical role in its accessibility. Abundant learning resources, tutorials, and documentation are readily available, empowering beginners to progress from basic programming principles to advanced backend development seamlessly. Online platforms like Codecademy, Coursera, realpython.com, and even Google offer comprehensive courses tailored to all skill levels.

#### Practical Applications and Popular Frameworks

Python's versatility is evident in its applicability across a spectrum of industries, from web development and data science to artificial intelligence and automation. In the context of backend development, Python shines brightly with its two standout frameworks: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask).

##### Django

So, let's talk about Django – it's like the superhero of web frameworks, at least in the world of Python. This high-level powerhouse is all about that "batteries-included" style, giving you a whole package of tools and features that make development lightning-fast. It follows the [Model-View-Controller](https://www.crio.do/blog/understand-mvc-architecture/) (MVC) architecture that gives your web applications a solid structure, making them scalable and easy to keep up.

Part of that whole “batteries-included” motto means that it comes with an admin panel, an [ORM](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-orm-the-meaning-of-object-relational-mapping-database-tools/) (Object-Relational Mapping) for smooth data handling, and security features that make sure your project is secured out-of-the-box. All these goodies work together, making Django a top choice for projects, whether they're a walk in the park or a brain-bending challenge.

##### Flask

On the other hand, Flask, a micro-framework, takes a minimalist approach, providing developers with the flexibility to choose components as needed. While Flask may be lighter than Django, it doesn't compromise on functionality. Its simplicity and modularity make it an excellent choice for small to medium-sized projects, allowing developers to tailor the framework to meet specific project requirements.

Both Django and Flask underscore Python's suitability for backend development, offering developers frameworks that cater to diverse project needs while maintaining Python's hallmark readability and efficiency.

#### Pros and Cons of Python

As with all other backend languages in this article, Python has some pros and cons you should consider before picking it as your first backend language.

##### Pros

- The syntax is very easy to learn because it’s very much like writing English.
- The ecosystem is quite mature and has some nice frameworks that will contain all the tools you need to get started

##### Cons

- It’s not the most popular backend language, so while the frameworks available are constantly updated, they aren’t necessarily using the latest technology trends.
- The GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) limits Python’s performance in multi-threaded applications.

### Java

Java has a massive presence and for good reason (according to [JetBrain’s survey in 2022, Java was used by 48% of developers](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php)).It's the kind of programming language that's everywhere – serving up websites, running your favorite apps, and even powering big-scale enterprise systems.

#### Is it worth learning Java?

Now, learning Java, (a strongly typed, object oriented programming language (OOP), is a journey worth taking, but it's not a walk in the park. It's a bit like climbing a mountain – you start at the bottom with the basics, and as you ascend, you get into the nitty-gritty of things like object-oriented programming. The process will force you to learn a lot, which is a great thing, by the end you’ll have a lot of understanding of mechanics and concepts around OOP that can be extrapolated into other languages. However, that can also be overwhelming to some developers who just want to learn by building mini-projects. In those situations, the learning curve of Java might be too long (not steep, but long because there is a lot more to cover than with alternatives such as Python or JavaScript).

That said, the community is big and there are tons of resources, from online courses to forums, helping you navigate the Java landscape. And good reason, considering Java has been around for quite a while.

#### Use Cases and Robust Ecosystem

Java's everywhere. From web development to mobile apps, and even diving into the world of big data, Java's got its fingerprints all over. And if it’s not the language itself, it’s the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) powering some other language, like Spark.

Java’s the language of choice for many big enterprises given its innate robustness (the first version of the language was released in 1995, it’s had quite a long time to evolve), and its robust ecosystem of libraries and frameworks makes it a go-to for developers.

#### Pros and Cons of Java

For all its power and robustness, there are some negative (and positive) aspects to picking Java as your first backend language.

##### Pros

- Java has a mature ecosystem with a varied array of libraries and frameworks for you to try. The community has been working on them and evolving them for years in many cases, so they’re quite ready to develop enterprise-ready solutions.
- Java’s multithreading support makes it ideal for some processing-heavy tasks in the backend of big applications.
- Java’s heavy focus on object oriented programming makes it a great option for developers who enjoy that paradigm.

##### Cons

- Java’s verbose syntax might be a problem for some people. While you can still code without an issue, it all comes down to personal preference. If you like to write less and do more with your code, Java might not be the ideal pick for you. It’s verbosity can increase development time in some situations.
- Java applications can have higher memory consumption than others, especially compared to others like PHP. While the reason for this is their entire architecture, the fact remains.

### JavaScript (Node.js)

With Node.js in the mix, JavaScript becomes a lingua franca in web development. In other words, you can use the same language both for the frontend (client side) and for the backend (server side) of your application.

That said, keep in mind that depending on the framework you’re using, while it might be JavaScript on both sides, the code and logic you use can be considerably different.

Remember that frontend code is often confused with framework code (as in React, Angular, Vue, etc) by some developers, simply because it’s all JavaScript. But don’t be confused, the backend lacks a lot of the extra “juice” added by the browser (like the DOM API and others).

#### Learning Advantages of Node.js

If you've got the basics of JavaScript down, even if your experience has only been on the frontend, diving into Node.js is like leveling up. It lets you use the same language for both frontend and backend, which means less time juggling languages and more time building cool stuff.

The event-driven, non-blocking architecture is one of the main features that make the language so special – it makes your web apps fast and efficient without you having to learn more complex concepts such as multi-threading. Plus, the community is constantly growing and there are tutorials everywhere to guide you through the Node.js universe.

If you were to rank languages based on the amount of content out there to learn them, JavaScript would be one of the first ones (if not the first one) on the list.

#### Key Frameworks and Development Tools

Now, let's talk about frameworks. In the case of JavaScript, this topic is so varied that recommending a single option for someone just getting started is really hard.

For example, if you want to go frontend agnostic, or in other words, you don’t care about the technology being used to develop the client side of your app, then a good starting option would be [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/). This framework used to be the industry standard. And while that’s no longer the case, it’s still a perfect first choice if you’re looking for something with the required functionality to make your life a lot easier.

Now, if on the other hand, you’re looking to build the frontend and the backend at the same time, then I would recommend going with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) if you’re already familiar with React. Or if on the other hand, you prefer Vue.js, then definitely try [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/). Either one of those will help you get the job done with all the bells and whistles you can think of.

#### Does it make sense to pick up JavaScript as a backend language?

The answer to this question is always going to be “yes”, whether you’re coming from the frontend and you already have JS experience or if you’re picking it up from scratch. In fact, according to [StackOverflow’s 2023 survey, JavaScript is the most used language by professionals](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#most-popular-technologies-language-prof) (with 65.85% of the votes).

![JavaScript Interest](/guides/backend-languages/javascript-interest.png)

If you’re coming from the client side, then adopting JS for your backend will let you start working in minutes. You’ll probably spend more time learning the backend-specific concepts than the language itself.

On the other hand, if you’re coming from zero, or from other programming languages, JS has some quirks, for sure, but if you go the JS route, you’re already making way for a potential switch into the frontend in the future. Who knows, maybe in a few months you’ll also want to start working on the frontend, and by having picked up JS as your main backend language, you have 90% of the work already cut for you.

There is really no downside to picking JS as your first backend language.

#### Pros and Cons of JavaScript

While there might not be a downside to picking JS, there is no perfect language out there, so let’s take a look at some of the pros and cons before moving on to the next one.

##### Pros

- Going with JavaScript, you’re using the same language on the backend and on the frontend. There is less cognitive load while switching environments if you’re the one coding both sides of the app.
- The ecosystem around JavaScript is one of the richest ones you can find. The community is constantly pushing the limits of the language and coming up with new solutions to everyday problems.
- The simple syntax allows you to reduce development time because you don’t have to write as much code to achieve good results.

##### Cons

- Asynchronous programming can be hard for some developers coming from other languages, like Python for example.
- The lack of strong types in JavaScript can cause some problems for big codebases.
- The single-thread nature of the language makes it really hard to implement CPU-intensive tasks. While there is support for multi-threading, it’s not extensive nor commonly used.
- Debugging asynchronous code can be difficult for new developers given the non-linear nature of it.

### PHP

Now, if you’re looking for something very well established in the web development industry, just like Java but with a shorter learning curve, then you’re probably looking for PHP.

> As a note about PHP’s relevancy, while many developers might claim that PHP is a dying tech, according to [W3Techs, over 75% of websites with a backend use PHP](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php).

It's the glue that holds a ton of websites together, and its longevity in the web development scene is no accident.

#### Ease of Mastery and Vast Library Support

If you're diving into PHP, you wouldn’t be so wrong (no matter what others might tell you). It's got a gentle learning curve, which means you can start building things pretty quickly. Getting everything set up and working will probably take you 10 minutes, and you’ll be writing your first “hello world” 5 minutes after that.

The vast community support and an ocean of online resources make mastering PHP a breeze. Plus, its library support is like having a toolkit that's always expanding – you'll find what you need, whether you're wrangling databases, handling forms, or making your website dance with dynamic content.

If you’re looking to pick up PHP, look for the LAMP stack, which stands for **L**inux, **A**pache, **M**ySQL, and **P**HP. With that tech stack, you’ll have everything you need to start creating websites in no time.

#### Modern PHP Frameworks and Their Impact

If we’re talking about PHP frameworks, then we gotta talk about [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [Symfony](https://symfony.com/). They are like the rockstars of the modern PHP world.

Laravel comes with a lot of tools and features that help you speed up your development process. On the other side, Symfony has a modular architecture, making it a solid choice for projects of all sizes.

These frameworks showcase how PHP has evolved, staying relevant and powerful in the ever-changing landscape of web development.

#### Pros and Cons of PHP

Let’s take a look at some of the most common advantages of going with PHP for the backend and some cons to discuss why it might not be the best choice for you.

##### Pros

- PHP is designed for web development, which still makes it a very popular choice for a backend language.
- PHP’s community is quite big, considering how old the language is, so if you need help, chances are, someone has the answer you’re looking for.

##### Cons

- One of the major complaints developers have about the language is its inconsistent function naming convention. While not a huge problem, it makes it very hard for developers to intuitively find the right function by name. This causes you to constantly verify your code against the documentation to make sure you’re not making mistakes.

### Go

Now, let's close in on Go, the programming language born at Google that's all about simplicity and efficiency. Go embraces a clean and straightforward syntax. Despite its simplicity, it focuses heavily on performance, making it an excellent choice for building modern, scalable applications.

According to the [PYPL index](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) (using Google searches to weigh interest of developers in a particular language), we can see a clear worldwide growing interest in Go from the development community:

![Go Interest](/guides/backend-languages/pypl-go-index.png)

#### Concurrency and Scalability

Go stands out in the crowd, especially when it comes to handling concurrency and scalability. Its built-in support for concurrent programming, through goroutines and channels, makes it a standout choice for applications that need to juggle multiple tasks simultaneously. This makes Go particularly adept at handling the demands of today's highly concurrent and distributed systems. In other words, Go is a great choice for building microservices, a type of system that is very commonly used as the backend for complex web applications.

So yes, very relevant.

#### Learning Curve and Developer Productivity

Learning Go is a smooth ride, thanks to its simplicity and extensive documentation. Developers often find themselves quickly transitioning from understanding the basics to building robust applications.

The language's focus on developer productivity is evident in its quick compilation times and the absence of excessive boilerplate code, allowing developers to concentrate on building features rather than wrestling with the language itself.

#### Pros and Cons of Go

Let’s take a look at some pros and cons for the last programming language on our list.

##### Pros

- Go code compiles quickly, which in turn leads to very fast development cycles. This is a big plus if you’re developing a big application with a large codebase because other options might slow down your process with their compilation times.
- Go's syntax is simple enough to make it easy to learn and understand for new developers.

##### Cons

- Go’s ecosystem is quite young when compared to the other alternatives here, so the maturity of the tools available might not be the same as, for example, Java or JavaScript tooling.

## Choosing the Ideal Backend Language

So, are these the best backend programming languages out there? Is there an absolute “best” backend programming language?

As you’ve probably seen by now, there is no “perfect” or “ideal” backend language. When it comes to picking one out of the huge number of alternatives, you have to consider other aspects outside of the language itself:

- What’s the size of your project? Are you building a large-scale platform? Or just a basic static website?
- Do you mind spending more time learning or do you need to be efficient and start coding right away?
- Do you already have some programming knowledge and would like to pick something that resembles what you already know? Or would you like to pick up something that’s entirely different?
- Are you alone? Or are you part of a team?

Once you’ve answered those questions, you’ll probably have some idea of where to go, but then you should look into the language itself, specifically into:

- Does it have enough learning resources for you?
- How big and active is the community around it?
- Are the main frameworks still under development? Or have they been parked for a while?

In the end, you’re evaluating the language and its ecosystem, making sure they’re both evolving right along the web industry. If you find that there are aspects that are falling behind, then it probably isn’t a good choice.

A handy tool when trying to evaluate a language like that is [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh).

[![Roadmap.sh](/guides/backend-languages/backend-roadmap-part.png)](https://roadmap.sh/backend)

<p align="center" style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: -10px; text-align: center">Small section of the full backend roadmap available on <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend">roadmap.sh</a></p>

There you’ll find community-maintained roadmaps for many career paths within software development. In particular, for this article, the [backend roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend) is a great place to start, because while picking a backend language is important, you’ll see there that it’s not just about the language. In fact, there is a lot of tech around the language that is also required (I’m referring to databases, git, understanding how client-server communication works, and a big “etc).

## Backend languages

When it comes to web development, there is a very clear distinction between frontend and backend technologies.

While the frontend ecosystem is quite limited to JavaScript (and other JavaScript-based languages, like TypeScript) due to Browser compatibility, the backend (A.K.A server-side) is a very different scenario.


Please note that neither of those lists is extensive, as they’re both constantly growing.

You can think of a backend language as one that “runs on the server side”. That said, by that definition, any language is a backend language because even JavaScript nowadays can be used on the backend as well (thanks to Node, Bun, and Deno).

However, we can go one step further and say:

> “A backend language is a server side programming language that has the tools and frameworks required to build web backends”

That will narrow down the list a little bit. But essentially, we can think of backend languages as anything that fits the following list:

- Is able to listen for incoming HTTP/S connections.
- Can access databases.
- Can send HTTP/S requests.
- Can access the filesystem.
- Has a rich ecosystem of tools and frameworks to build web applications.

With those features and a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, a language can definitely be considered “backend-ready”.

## Guided Learning: From Online Courses to Bootcamps

Online courses and bootcamps serve as invaluable companions on your learning expedition. Platforms like Udemy, Coursera, and freeCodeCamp offer comprehensive backend development courses.

These resources not only cover programming languages like Python, Java, or JavaScript but also dive deep into frameworks like Django, Express.js, or Laravel. For those seeking a more immersive experience, coding bootcamps provide intensive, hands-on training to fast-track your backend development skills.

Whatever choice you go for, make sure you’re not following trends or just copying the learning methods of others. Learning is a very personal experience and what works for others might not work for you, and vice versa. So make sure to do the proper research and figure out what option works best for you.

## Building Community Connections for Learning Support

Joining developer communities (there are several on Twitter for example), forums like Stack Overflow, or participating in social media groups dedicated to backend development creates a network of support.

Engaging with experienced developers, sharing challenges, and seeking advice fosters a collaborative learning environment. Attend local meetups or virtual events if you can to connect with professionals in the field, gaining insights and building relationships that can prove invaluable throughout your journey.

## Think about you and your project

There are many ways to go about picking the ideal backend language for you. If there is anything you should take home with you after reading this article, it is that most languages are equivalent in the sense that you’ll be able to do pretty much everything with any of them.

So what criteria can you use to pick the “right one” for you?

The questions you should also be asking yourself are:

- What’s your preference for a language? Do you like Object Oriented Programming (OOP) or are you more of a functional programming type of dev? Do you like statically typed programming languages or loosely typed ones? Personal preferences should also play an important role at the time of picking your ideal programming language.
- What does my project need? After all, project requirements sometimes dictate technology. Keep that in mind, check if the project’s needs and your personal preferences align, and try to weigh in pros and cons if they don’t.

In the end, personal preference and actual project requirements (if you have any) are very important, because both will influence how much you enjoy (or don’t enjoy) the learning process.

## Crafting a Portfolio to Display Your Backend Skills:

As you accumulate skills and knowledge, showcase your journey through a well-crafted portfolio. Include projects that highlight your backend skills, demonstrating your ability to - design databases, implement server-side logic, and integrate with client side technologies. Whether it's a dynamic web application, a RESTful API, or a data-driven project, your portfolio becomes a tangible representation of your backend development capabilities for potential employers or collaborators.

When it comes to deciding where to publish this portfolio, you have some options, such as directly on your GitHub profile (if you have one), or perhaps on your own personal website where you can share some design thoughts about each project along with the code.

In the end, the important thing is that you should be sharing your experience somewhere, especially when you don’t have working experience in the field.

## Conclusion

In the end, there are many backend programming languages to choose from, and what language you go for, is up to you and your particular context/needs. All I can do is guide you to the door, but you have to cross it yourself. Some interesting options are:

- Python with its English-like syntax.
- Java with its formal syntax and enterprise support.
- JavaScript with its flexibility and ability to jump between frontend and backend.
- PHP with its proven record of success.
- And Go, with its performance and scalability focus.

You’re the one who gets to decide, but just know that no matter what you choose, getting started in backend development is a one-way street. You’ll be learning from this moment on, and you’ll be jumping from one language to the other as the field evolves.

Remember that there is a very detailed version of a [backend roadmap here](https://roadmap.sh/backend), it might be a great place to get started! And if you’re also interested in frontend development, there is an [equally handy roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) here as well!



As backend developers, showcasing our work to others is not straightforward, given that what we do is not very visible.

That said, having a project portfolio, even as backend developers, it’s very important, as it can lead to new job opportunities.

As an added bonus, the experience you get out of the entire process of building the apps for your portfolio will help you improve your coding skills.

Let’s take a look at 20 of the best backend projects you can work on to improve both your project portfolio and to [learn backend development](https://roadmap.sh/backend).

Keep in mind that these project ideas are organized from easiest to hardest to complete, and the entire list should take you at least a year to complete, if you’re not rushing the process.

So sit back, grab a cup of your favorite hot drink, and let’s get started!

## 1. Personal Blogging Platform API

**Difficulty**: Easy

**_Skills and technologies used_**: CRUD for main operations, databases (SQL or NoSQL), server-side RESTful API.

![Blogging Platform API](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/blogging-platform-api.png)

Let’s start with a very common one when it comes to backend projects.

This is a RESTful API that would power a personal blog. This implies that you’d have to create a backend API with the following responsibilities:

- Return a list of articles. You can add filters such as publishing date, or tags.
- Return a single article, specified by the ID of the article.
- Create a new article to be published.
- Delete a single article, specified by the ID.
- Update a single article, again, you’d specify the article using its ID.

And with those endpoints you’ve covered the basic CRUD operations (**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate and **D**elete).

As a recommendation for techstack, you could use [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) as the main backend framework if you’re going with Node, or perhaps [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for Python or even [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) or [Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com/) for Ruby. As for your database, you could use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) if you want to try NoSQL or [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) if you’re looking to get started with relational databases first.

## 2. To-Do List API

**_Difficulty_**: Easy

**_Skills and technologies used_**: REST API design, JSON, basic authentication middleware.

![To-Do List API](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/todo-list-api-bsrdd.png)

We’re continuing with the APIs for our backend project ideas, this time around for a To-Do application. Why is it different from the previous one?

While the previous project only focused on the main CRUD operations, here we’ll add some more interesting responsibilities, such as:

1. An authentication logic, which means you’ll have to keep a new table of users and their credentials
2. You’ll have to create both users and tasks.
3. You’ll also have to be able to update tasks (their status) and even delete them.
4. Get a list of tasks, filter them by status and get the details of each one.

You’re free to implement this with whatever programming language and framework you want, however, you could continue using the same stack from the previous project.

## 3. Weather API Wrapper Service

**_Difficulty_**: Easy

**_Skills and technologies used_**: Third-party API integration, caching strategy, environment variable management.

![Weather API Wrapper Service](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/weather-api-f8i1q.png)

Let’s take our API magic to the next level with this new backend project. Now instead of just relying on a database, we’re going to tackle two new topics:

- Using external services.
- Adding caching through the use of a quick in-memory storage.

As for the actual weather API to use, you can use your favorite one, as a suggestion, here is a link to [Visual Crossing’s API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api), it’s completely FREE and easy to use.

Regarding the in-memory cache, a pretty common recommendation is to use [Redis](https://redis.io/), you can read more about it [here](https://redis.io/docs/manual/client-side-caching/), and as a recommendation, you could use the city code entered by the user as the key, and save there the result from calling the API.

At the same time, when you “set” the value in the cache, you can also give it an expiration time in seconds (using the EX flag on the [SET command](https://redis.io/commands/set/)). That way the cache (the keys) will automatically clean itself when the data is old enough (for example, giving it a 12-hours expiration time).

## 4. Expense Tracker API

**_Difficulty_**: Easy

**_Skills and technologies used_**: Data modeling, user authentication (JWT).

![Expense Tracker API](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/expense-tracker-api-m72p5.png)

For the last of our “easy” backend projects, let’s cover one more API, an expense tracker API. This API should let you:

- Sign up as a new user.
- Generate and validate JWT tokens for handling authentication and user session.
- List and filter your past expenses. You can add the following filters:
    - Past week.
    - Last month.
    - Last 3 months.
    - Custom (to specify a start and end date of your choosing).
- Add new expenses.
- Remove existing expenses.
- Update existing expenses.

Let’s now add some constraints:

- You’ll be using [JWT](https://itnext.io/demystifying-jwt-a-guide-for-front-end-developers-ead6574531c3) (JSON Web Token) to protect the endpoints and to identify the requester.
- For the different expense categories, you can use the following list (feel free to decide how to implement this as part of your data model):
    - Groceries
    - Leisure
    - Electronics
    - Utilities
    - Clothing
    - Health
    - Others.

As a recommendation, you can use MongoDB or an ORM for this project, such as [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) (if you’re using JavaScript/Node for this).

From everything you’ve done so far, you should feel pretty confident next time you have to build a new API.

## 5. Markdown Note-taking App

**_Difficulty_**: Moderate

**_Skills and technologies used_**: Text processing, Markdown libraries, persistent storage, REST API with file upload.

![Markdown Note-taking App](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/markdown-note-taking-app-tymi3.png)

You’ve been building APIs all this time, so that concept alone should not be a problem by now. However, we’re increasing the difficulty by allowing file uploads through your RESTful API. You’ll need to understand how that part works inside a RESTful environment and then figure out a strategy to store those files while avoiding name collisions.

You’ll also have to process the text in the following ways:

- You’ll provide an endpoint to check the grammar of the note.
- You’ll also provide an endpoint to save the note that can be passed in as Markdown text.
- Return the HTML version of the Markdown note (rendered note) through another endpoint.

As a recommendation, if you’re using JavaScript for this particular project, you could use a library such as [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer), which is a Node.js module.

## 6. URL Shortening Service

**_Difficulty_**: Moderate

**_Skills and technologies used_**: Database indexing, HTTP redirects, RESTful endpoints

![URL Shortening Service](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/url-shortening-service-c1nzi.png)

We’re now moving away from your standard APIs, and tackling URL shortening. This is a very common service, which allows you to shorten very long URLs, especially when looking to share them on social media or make them easily memorable.

For this project idea let’s focus on the following features, which you should be more than capable of implementing on your local environment, no matter your OS.

- Ability to pass a long URL as part of the request and get a shorter version of it. You’re free to decide how you’ll perform the shortening .
- Save the shorter and longer versions of the URL in the database to be used later during redirection.
- Configure a catch-all route on your service that gets all the traffic (no matter the URI used), finds the correct longer version and performs a redirection so the user is seamlessly redirected to the proper destination.

## 7. Real-time Polling App

**_Difficulty_**: Moderate

**_Skills and technologies used_**: WebSockets, live data updates, state management

![Real-time Polling App](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/realtime-polling-app-8qx5h.png)

Time to leave APIs alone for a while and focus on real-time interactions, another hot topic in web development. In fact, let’s try to use some sockets.

Sockets are a fantastic way of enabling 2-way communication between two or more parties (systems) with very few lines of code. Read more about sockets [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-sockets).

That being said, we’re building both a client and a server for this project. The client can easily be a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool or a terminal program that will connect to the server and show the information being returned in real-time.

The flow for this first socket-based project is simple:

- The client connects to the server and sends a pre-defined request.
- The server upon receiving this request, will send, through the same channel, an automatic response.

While the flow might seem very similar to how HTTP-based communication works, the implementation is going to be very different. Keep in mind that from the client perspective, the request is sent, and there is no waiting logic, instead, the client will have code that gets triggered when the message from the server is received.

This is a great first step towards building more complex socket-based systems.

## 8. Simple E-commerce API

**_Difficulty_**: Moderate

**_Skills and technologies used_**: Shopping cart logic, payment gateway integration (Stripe, PayPal), product inventory management

![Simple E-commerce API](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/simple-ecommerce-api-thzqo.png)

Back to the world of APIs, this time around we’re pushing for a logic-heavy implementation.

For this one, you’ll have to keep in mind everything we’ve been covering so far:

- JWT authentication to ensure many users can interact with it.
- Interaction with external services. Here you’ll be integrating with payment gateways such as Stripe.
- A complex data model that can handle products, shopping carts, and more.

With that in mind, let’s take a look at the responsibilities of this system:

- JWT token creation and validation to handle authorization.
- Ability to create new users.
- Shopping cart management, which involves payment gateway integration as well.
- Product listings.
- Ability to create and edit products in the database.

This project might not seem like it has a lot of features, but it compensates in complexity, so don’t skip it, as it acts as a great progress check since it’s re-using almost every skill you’ve picked up so far.

## 9. Fitness Workout Tracker

**_Difficulty_**: Moderate

**_Skills and technologies used_**: User-specific data storage, CRUD for workout sessions, date-time manipulation.

![Fitness Workout Tracker](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/fitness-workout-tracker-82uux.png)

This backend project is not just about taking in user-generated notes, but rather, about letting users create their own workout schedules with their own exercises and then go through them, checking the ones they’ve done, and the ones they haven't.

Making sure you also give them the space to add custom notes, with remarks about how the exercise in question felt and if they want to tweak it in the future.

Keep in mind the following responsibilities for this backend project:

- There needs to be a user sign-up and log-in flow in this backend system, as many users should be able to use it.
- There needs to be a secure JWT flow for authentication.
- The system should let users create workouts composed of multiple exercises.
- For each workout, the user will be able to update it and provide comments on it.
- The schedule the user creates needs to be associated to a specific date, and any listing of active or pending workouts needs to also be sorted by date (and time if you want to take it one step further).
- There should also be a report of past workouts, showing the percentage of finished workouts during the queried period.

The data model for this one can also be complex, as you’ll have predefined exercises that need to be grouped into workout sessions, and those can then have associated comments (input from the user).

![Fitness Workout Tracker Data Model](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/fitness-workout-tracker-datamodel-5mrkq.png)

Consider the benefits of using a structured model here vs something document-based, such as MongoDB and pick the one that feels better for your implementation.

## 10. Recipe Sharing Platform

**_Difficulty_**: Moderate

**_Skills and technologies used_**: File uploads and image processing (like Sharp), user permissions, complex querying

![Recipe Sharing Platform](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/recipe-sharing-platform-jzs08.png)

While this project might feel a lot like the first one, the personal blogging platform, we’re taking the same concept, and then adding a lot more on top of it.

We’re building a RESTful API (or rather several) that will let you perform the following actions:

- Access a list of recipes. You should be able to filter by keywords (text input), publication date, by chef, and by labels. Access to this endpoint should be public.
- The list should be paginated, and as part of the response on every page.
- Users should be able to sign up as chefs to the system to upload their own recipes.
- A JWT-secured login flow must be present to protect the endpoints in charge of creating new recipe posts.
- Images uploaded as part of the recipe should be processed to be re-sized into a standard size (you pick the dimensions). You can use a library such as [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) for this.

## 11. Movie Reservation System

**_Difficulty_**: Difficult

**_Skills and technologies used_**: Relational data modeling (SQL), seat reservation logic, transaction management, schedule management.

![Movie Reservation System](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/movie-reservation-system-5823e.png)

There are very expensive pre-made tools that handle all this logic for companies, and the following diagram shows you a glimpse of that complexity.

As backend projects go, this one is a great example of the many different problems you might need to solve while working in web development.

A movie reservation system should allow any user to get tickets and their associated seats for any movie playing the specific day the user is looking to attend. This description alone already provides a lot of features and constraints we have to keep in mind:

- We’re going to have a list of movies (and maybe theaters as well).
- Each movie will have a recurring schedule for some time and then it’ll be taken out to never return.
- Users should be able to list movies, search for them and filter by dates, genres and even actors.
- Once found, the user should be able to pick the seats for their particular movie of choice, and for their date of choice.
- This leads us to you having to keep a virtual representation of your movie theater to understand seating distribution and availability.
- In the end, the user should also be able to pay using an external payment gateway such as Stripe (we’ve already covered this step in the past).

## 12. Restaurant Review Platform (API) with automatic NLP analysis

**_Difficulty_**: Difficult

**_Skills and technologies used_**: RESTful API, In-memory database (for live leaderboard), SQL, Natural Language Processing to auto-label positive and negative comments.

![Restaurant Review Platform](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/restaurant-review-platform-26c1f.png)

Now this project takes a turn into the land of noSQL and AI by leading with user input. The aim of this particular backend project is to provide a very simple API that will let users:

- Input their own review of a restaurant (ideally, the API should request the restaurant’s ID to make sure users are reviewing the correct one).
- Keep a leaderboard of restaurants with a generic positive or negative score, based on the type of reviews these restaurants get. For this, you can use Redis as an in-memory leaderboard to have your API query it, instead of hitting the database you’re using. This also implies that you’ll have to keep the leaderboard updated on Redis as well (as a hint: look for type [SortedSet](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/sorted-sets/) data type to understand how to do this).
- Perform NLP (Natural Language Processing) on the user’s text portion of the review, to understand if it’s a positive one or a negative one.
- Use the result of the NLP as a scoring system for the leaderboard.

As a recommendation, you might want to use Python on this project, as there tend to be more libraries around NLP for this language.

## 13. Multiplayer Battleship Game Server

**Difficulty**: Difficult

**_Skills and technologies used_**: Game state synchronization, low-latency networking, concurrency control.

![Multiplayer Battleship Game Server](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/multiplayer-battleship-lv5oj.png)

For this project you’re not going to build a full game from scratch, so don’t worry.

You will however, build a game server. Your game server will have to maintain the internal state of each player’s board, and it should also enable communication between them by broadcasting their actions and results. Since we have “low-latency networking” as a constraint here, the logical implementation would be through the use of Sockets (so if you haven’t done it yet, go back to project 7 and work on it first).

You’re free to pick the programming language you feel more comfortable with, however, keep the mind that you’ll have to:

- Keep track of the player's state and game state.
- Enable 2-way communication between players and server.
- Allow players to join the game and set up their initial state somehow.

This can be a very fun project to work on, even if you’re “just” building a terminal version of this multiplayer game, as you’ll be using several of the concepts and technologies covered so far on this list.

## 14. Database Backup CLI utility

**_Difficulty_**: Difficult

**_Skills and technologies used_**: Advanced SQL, Database fundamentals, CLI development, Node.js (for CLI)

![Database Backup CLI utility](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/database-backup-cli-jwrcj.png)

We’re now moving away from the API world for a while, and into the world of command line interfaces, which is another very common space for backend developers to work on.

This time around, the project is a CLI utility to back up an entire database.

So for this project, you’ll be creating a command line utility that takes the following attributes:

- **Host:** the host of your database (it can be localhost or anything else).
- **Username**: the utility will need a username to login and query the database.
- **Password**: same with the password, usually databases are protected this way.
- **DB Name**: the name of the database to backup. We’re backing up the entire set of tables inside this database.
- **Destination folder**: the folder where all the dump files will be stored.

With all that information, your utility should be able to connect to the database, pull the list of tables, and for each one understand its structure and its data. In the end, the resulting files inside the destination folder should have everything you need to restore the database on another server simply by using these files.

Finally, if you haven’t heard of it yet, you might want to check out the [SHOW CREATE TABLE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/show-create-table.html) statement.

## 15. Online Code Compiler API

**_Difficulty_**: Difficult

**_Skills and technologies used_**: Sandboxing code execution, integration with compilers, WebSocket communication.

![Online Code Compiler API](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/online-code-compiler-c7xjb.png)

For this project, you’ll be building the backend of a remote code execution application. In other words, your APIs will allow you to receive source code written using a specific language of choice (you can pick the one you want, and only allow that one), run it and then return the output of that execution.

Of course, doing this without any restrictions is not worth it for being in the “difficult” section of this list, so let’s kick it up a notch:

- The code execution should be done inside a safe sandbox, which means that the code can’t hurt or affect the system it’s running on, no matter what the code or the logic dictates.
- On top of that, for long-running tasks, the API should also provide a status report containing the following information:
- Time running.
- Start time of the execution.
- Lines of code being executed.

## 16. Messaging Platform Backend

**_Difficulty_**: Difficult

**_Skills and technologies used_**: Real-time messaging, end-to-end encryption, contact synchronization

![Messaging Platform Backend](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/messaging-platform-backend-96jpw.png)

Yes, we’re talking about a chat platform here. And as a backend developer you’re more than ready to implement both the server and the client application.

This backend project would take project #7 to the next level, by implementing the following responsibilities:

- Adding message encryption between client applications
- The ability to understand who’s online
- Understand if those users are interacting with you (a.k.a showing the “\[username\] is typing” message in real-time).
- Sending a message from one of the clients into the server should be broadcasted to the rest of the clients connected.

As a recommendation for technology implementing this project, [Socket.io](http://socket.io) would be a perfect match. This means you’d be using JavaScript (node.js) for this.

## 17. Content Delivery Network (CDN) Simulator

**_Difficulty_**: Very Difficult

**_Skills and technologies used_**: Load balancing algorithms, caching strategies, network latency simulation

![Content Delivery Network (CDN) Simulator](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/cdn-simulator-lv7kl.png)

For this particular backend project, we’re not going to focus on coding, but rather on backend tools and their configuration. A [CDN](https://aws.amazon.com/es/what-is/cdn/) (or Content Delivery Network) is a platform that allows you to serve static content (like text files, images, audio, etc) safely and reliably.

Instead of having all files inside the same server, the content is replicated and distributed across a network of servers that can provide you with the files at any given point in time.

The point of this project is for you to figure out a way to set up your own CDN keeping in mind the following points:

- Use cloud servers (you can pick your favorite cloud provider for this)
- Configure a load balancer to distribute the load between all servers.
- Set up a caching strategy.

Remember that all major cloud providers have a free tier that allows you to use all their services for some time. AWS for example, allows for a full year of free tier limited to the type of resources you can use.

## 18. Time-tracking CLI for Freelancers

**_Difficulty_**: Very Difficult

**_Skills and technologies used_**: time tracking, interactive CLI, Day.js for time operations, reporting.

![Time-tracking CLI for Freelancers](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/time-tracking-cli-freelancers-x7ldv.png)

As freelancers, sometimes understanding what you’re working on, or understanding how much time you’ve spent on a particular project once it’s time to get paid, can be a challenge.

So, with this command line interface tool, we’ll try to solve that pain for freelancers. The tool you’re developing should let you specify that you’re starting to work on a project, and once you’re done, you should also be able to say that you’ve stopped.

On top of that, there should be an interactive reporting mode that should tell you the amount of time spent so far on a particular project (with the ability to filter by date and time), so you can know exactly how much to charge each client.

From the user’s POV, you could have commands like this:

- freelance start project1
- freelance stop project2

And when in interactive mode, something like this should work:

- report project1 since 1/2/24

The challenge on this backend project is not just the CLI itself, which you’ve built in the past, but the actual time tracking logic that needs to happen internally. You’ll be keeping track of small chunks of time associated with different backend projects, and once the report is requested, you need to properly query your DB and get only the right chunks, so you can later add them up and return a valid number.

## 19. JS Obfuscator CLI utility

**_Difficulty_**: Very Difficult

**_Skills and technologies used_**: code obfuscation, batch processing of files using a CLI, Node.js.

![JS Obfuscator CLI utility](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/js-obfuscator-utility-f0dfi.png)

Code obfuscation happens when you turn a perfectly readable code into something that only a machine can understand, without changing the plain text nature of the file. In other words, you just make it impossible for a human to read and understand.

Many tools do this in the JS ecosystem, it’s now your turn to create a new tool and perform the exact same action. As an added difficulty, you’ll be coding a tool that does this to an entire folder filled with files (not just one at the time).

Make sure the output for each file is placed inside the same folder, with a “.obs.js” extension, and that you’re also navigating sub-folders searching for more files.

Try to avoid libraries that already perform these exact same tasks, as you’ll be skipping through all the potential problems you can find, and effectively learning nothing from the experience.

## 20. Web Scraper CLI

**_Difficulty_**: Very Difficult

**_Skills and technologies used_**: Web scraping, headless browsing, rules engine

![Web Scraper CLI](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/webscraper-cli-ja5h2.png)

A web scraper is a tool that allows you to navigate a website through code, and in the process, capture information from the presented web pages.

As part of the last backend project of this list, you’ll be implementing your very own web scraper CLI tool. This tool will take input from the user with a list of preset commands, such as:

- show code: to list the HTML code of the current page.
- navigate: to open a new URL
- capture: this will return a subsection of the HTML of the current page using the CSS selector you specify.
- click on: this command will trigger a click on a particular HTML element using a CSS selector provided.

Feel free to add extra commands to make the navigation even more interactive.

With the last of our backend project ideas, you’ve covered all the major areas involved in backend development and you’re more than ready to apply for a backend development job if you haven’t already.

If you find a piece of technology that wasn’t covered here, you’ll have the skills required to pick it up in no time.
