# gRPC

gRPC is a high-performance, open source universal RPC framework

RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call, there's an ongoing debate on what the g stands for. RPC is a protocol that allows a program to execute a procedure of another program located on another computer. The great advantage is that the developer doesnâ€™t need to code the details of the remote interaction. The remote procedure is called like any other function. But the client and the server can be coded in different languages.
