# Angular Libraries

Angular has a rich ecosystem of libraries that provide pre-built solutions for various common tasks in web development. These libraries can help enhance the functionality of your Angular applications, such as improving performance, adding features, or integrating with third-party services.

**UI Component Libraries**:This includes:-

`Angular Material` - A popular library that provides a set of UI components following Google’s Material Design principles. It includes components like buttons, dialogs, toolbars, and form controls, and it is fully integrated with Angular.

npm install @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations

`NG Bootstrap` - Provides native Angular widgets built from the ground up using Bootstrap. It offers components like modals, tooltips, popovers, and more, without needing jQuery.

npm install @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap

`PrimeNG` - A rich set of UI components including buttons, data tables, charts, calendars, and more. PrimeNG is known for its extensive feature set and high customizability.

npm install primeng

`Angular Flex Layout` - A responsive layout library that provides a flexible grid system for building responsive layouts with Angular. It works seamlessly with Angular Material.

npm install @angular/flex-layout

**State Management Libraries**:-

`NgRx` - A powerful library for managing state in Angular applications using Redux principles. It provides tools for handling state, actions, and effects, along with devtools integration.

npm install @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects @ngrx/store-devtools

`Akita` - A state management pattern for Angular that is simpler than NgRx. It uses a store service to store the application's state and provides a more flexible and less boilerplate-heavy approach than NgRx.

npm install @datorama/akita

`NgXs` - A state management library for Angular with an emphasis on simplicity. It reduces boilerplate code, unlike NgRx, and is designed for easy integration with Angular.

npm install @ngxs/store

**Routing and Navigation Libraries**:-

`Angular Router` - The Angular Router is a built-in library that helps manage navigation and routing in Angular applications. It allows you to configure paths, lazy load modules, and define route guards.

`ngx-translate` - A library that provides internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) for Angular applications, enabling easy translation of your application’s content.

npm install @ngx-translate/core @ngx-translate/http-loader

**Forms and Validation Libraries**:-

`Angular Reactive Forms` - A powerful way of managing forms with Angular. It provides features like form validation, dynamic form controls, and complex form structures.

`ng2-validation` - A lightweight validation library that helps add custom validations to Angular forms, including email, URL, number, and others.

npm install ng2-validation

`ngx-formly` - A library for building dynamic forms in Angular. It allows you to easily configure forms using JSON schema, making it easier to handle complex forms.

npm install @ngx-formly/core @ngx-formly/material

**HTTP and API Libraries**:-

`HttpClient` - Angular’s built-in HTTP library for making requests to REST APIs. It simplifies making HTTP requests and handling responses, including handling interceptors, error handling, and response transformations.

`Axios` - Axios is a popular promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript that can be used in Angular for handling HTTP requests. It offers features like request and response interceptors and supports promises and async/await.

npm install axios

**Authentication and Authorization Libraries**:-

`AngularFire` - A library to integrate Firebase with Angular, providing easy access to Firebase services like authentication, real-time database, cloud functions, and Firestore.

npm install firebase @angular/fire

`OAuth2.0 / OpenID Connect (OIDC) with Angular` - Libraries like angular-oauth2-oidc make it easier to integrate OAuth2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) into your Angular app for secure authentication.

npm install angular-oauth2-oidc

`Keycloak` - A widely used open-source identity and access management solution. You can use the keycloak-angular library to integrate Keycloak authentication with Angular.

npm install keycloak-angular

**Animations Libraries**:-

`Angular Animations` - The built-in animation API in Angular provides tools to create rich animations. You can define trigger-based animations, such as sliding, fading, or expanding elements.

`ngx-animate` - A library providing pre-built animations for Angular components, making it easier to add simple animations without complex code.

npm install ngx-animate

**Testing Libraries**:-

`Jasmine` - A behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code, and the default testing framework used in Angular projects.

`Karma` - A test runner that works with Jasmine (and other frameworks) to run unit tests in real browsers.

`Protractor` - End-to-end testing framework for Angular applications that supports browser automation and testing of Angular components.

`Cypress` - A modern end-to-end testing framework that provides fast, reliable testing for Angular applications.

npm install cypress

**Utility and Helper Libraries**:-

`Lodash` - A utility library that offers a wide range of functions for working with arrays, objects, and other data types.

npm install lodash

`Moment.js` - A widely-used library for working with dates and times. However, it's now in maintenance mode and has been replaced by alternatives like Day.js and date-fns.

npm install moment

`Day.js` - A lightweight alternative to Moment.js for working with dates.

npm install dayjs

`ngx-toastr` - A simple and easy-to-use library for showing toast notifications in Angular applications.

npm install ngx-toastr
