# Directives

Directives are core feature that allows you to extend HTML by attaching custom behavior to elements and components.They help to manipulate the DOM,add event and control rendering dynamically. A directive is a class with a @Directive() decorator.

Types of directives includes:-

1. Component directives - custom HTML elements with templates and behavior.
2. Structural directives - Modify DOM structure.
3. Attribute directives - Change behavior or appearance of an element.

## Component directives

A Component is a special type of directive that has a template(view).It is commonly used directive in Angular.Component directive must have a selector and a template.
A component is technically a directive. However, components are so distinctive and central to Angular applications that Angular defines the @Component() decorator, which extends the @Directive() decorator with template-oriented features.

Angular templates are dynamic. When Angular renders them, it transforms the DOM according to the instructions given by directives.

You can define your own using the @Directive() decorator.

Just as for components, the metadata for a directive associates the decorated class with a selector element that you use to insert it into HTML. In templates, directives typically appear within an element tag as attributes, either by name or as the target of an assignment or a binding.

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-direct',
  standalone: true,
  templateUrl: './direct.component.html',
  styleUrl: './direct.component.css'
})
export class DirectComponent {

}
```

The common directive that can be used in HTML is `<app-direct> </app-direct>`

## Structural directives

Structural directives are directives which change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.Structural directives alter layout by adding, removing, and replacing elements in the DOM. The example template uses two built-in structural directives to add application logic to how the view is rendered.

Angular provides a set of built-in structural directives (such as NgIf, NgForOf, NgSwitch and others) which are commonly used in all Angular projects

If a directive modifies the structure of template by removing or adding an element you use an aestrik.E.g *ngFor

- The [ngIf] directive - is used to conditionally display or hide elements based on a given expression. It adds or removes elements from the DOM based on the truthiness of the expression.Angular's ngIf directive is used to conditionally render content in the template based on an expression in the component. It allows the component to control the visibility of elements based on certain conditions. It is used by adding the ngIf directive to an element and providing it with the expression to evaluate.

A structural directive that conditionally includes a template based on the value of an expression coerced to Boolean. When the expression evaluates to true, Angular renders the template provided in a then clause, and when false or null, Angular renders the template provided in an optional else clause. The default template for the else clause is blank.

When NgIf is false, Angular removes an element and its descendants from the DOM. Angular then disposes of their components, which frees up memory and resources.

```ts
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-direct',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule],
  templateUrl: './direct.component.html',
  styleUrl: './direct.component.css'
})
export class DirectComponent {

  courses =[1]
}
```

```html
<div *ngIf="courses.length>0">
   List of courses
</div>
<div *ngIf="courses.length==0">
   No courses Yet
</div>
```

OR to avoid repeating ngIf use:-

```html
<div *ngIf="courses.length>0; else noCourses">
   List of courses
</div>
<ng-template #noCourses>
   No courses Yet
</ng-template>
```

Or use this approach for consistency:-

```html
<div *ngIf="courses.length>0; then Courses else noCourses">
</div>
<ng-template #Courses>
   List of courses
</ng-template>
<ng-template #noCourses>
   No courses Yet
</ng-template>
```

- The [ngFor] directive - The "ngFor" directive is used to iterate over a collection of items in Angular and generate the corresponding HTML elements for each item.
Angular's ngFor directive is used to iterate over a collection and generate HTML elements for each item in the collection. It allows the component to dynamically
render elements based on the data in the collection. It is used by adding the ngFor directive to an element and providing it with the collection to iterate over.

The "trackBy" function is used in conjunction with the ngFor directive in Angular to improve the performance of rendering lists. It provides away to uniquely identify and track items in the collection, allowing Angular to optimize the rendering process by reusing existing DOM elements instead of recreating them.

The "trackBy" function in Angular ngFor is used to optimize the rendering of lists by providing a unique identifier for each item. It helps Angular in identifying changes in
the list and updating only the necessary elements in the DOM.

```ts
courses = ["course1","course2","course3"]
```

```html
<ul>
   <li *ngFor="let course of courses; index as i">{{ course }}</li>
</ul>
```

- The [ngSwitch] directive on a container specifies an expression to match against. The expressions to match are provided by ngSwitchCase directives on views within the container.The `"ngSwitch"` directive is used to conditionally render content based on the value of an expression. It allows for multiple cases and provides an alternative to nested ngIf statements.

Angular's ngSwitch directive is used to conditionally render content based on the value of an expression in the component. It allows the component to choose among
multiple templates based on the value of an expression. It is used by adding the ngSwitch directive to a container element and providing it with the expression to evaluate.

1. Every view that matches is rendered.
2. If there are no matches, a view with the ngSwitchDefault directive is rendered.
3. Elements within the [NgSwitch] statement but outside of any NgSwitchCase or ngSwitchDefault directive are preserved at the location.

The @for block is part of the new control flow syntax introduced in Angular 17.0
The control flow blocks ( @if , @for , @switch ) are here to replace the 3 structural directives ngIf , ngFor and ngSwitch .
In the case of the @for block, feature wise they serve the same purpse with a few advantages :
• No need to import the directive in standalone components
• Generate a bit less code in the final bundle
• enable better DX for track by passing a key directly.
• Make devs more concious about the track functionality by making it required.
• Nice DX for empty for-loops with the @empty block

```ts
@for (car of cars; track car.id) {
<option [value]="car.value">{{car.viewValue}}</option>
}
```

instead of *ngFor

```ts
<option *ngFor="let car of cars" [value]="car.value">{{car.viewValue}}</option>
```

The @for block makes it easier to loop through items in a collection and manage them efficiently.Unlike NgFor, which needs a trackBy function to identify each item uniquely, @for just needs a simple tracking expression.
If the collection is empty, you can use the @empty block to display something specific.Also, @for automatically figures out the least amount of changes needed to update the list on the screen, making it more efficient than NgFor, which allowed for custom ways to track changes but @for doesn't support that.

## Attribute directives

Change the appearance or behavior of DOM elements and Angular components with attribute directives.Attribute directives alter the appearance or behavior of an existing element. In templates they look like regular HTML attributes, hence the name.

The `ngModel` directive, which implements two-way data binding, is an example of an attribute directive. ngModel modifies the behavior of an existing element (typically <input>) by setting its display value property and responding to change events.

The `ng-app` directive is used to define the root element of an AngularJS application.It initializes the application and auto-bootstraps the AngularJS framework.

The `"ngStyle"` directive is used to dynamically apply styles to an element based on the values of expressions in the component. It allows for dynamic styling without directly manipulating the CSS classes.Angular's ngStyle directive is used to conditionally apply inline styles to an element based on expressions in the component. It allows dynamic style binding by evaluating the expressions and applying the styles accordingly. It is used by adding the ngStyle directive to an element and providing it with the desired style bindings.

The `"ngClass"` directive is used to conditionally apply CSS classes to an element based on the values of expressions in the component. It allows for dynamic class
binding.Angular's ngClass directive is used to conditionally apply CSS classes to an element based on expressions in the component. It allows dynamic class binding by
evaluating the expressions and adding or removing CSS classes accordingly. It is used by adding the ngClass directive to an element and providing it with the desired
class bindings.

The `"ngModel"` directive is used for two-way data binding between a form input element and a component property. It allows the component to get and set the value
of the input element.

The `"ng-container"` directive is a structural directive that acts as a grouping element without rendering any additional element to the DOM. It is often used to apply
structural directives to multiple elements.
Angular's ng-container directive is a grouping element that does not generate any additional DOM element. It is used to apply structural directives to multiple elements without the need for a wrapping element. It is often used in conjunction with ngIf, ngFor, and ngTemplateOutlet to structure the layout and logic of the template.
ng-content is a placeholder element in Angular that allows the insertion of content from the parent component into a child component. It is used to create reusable
components with customizable content.

The `"ng-content"` directive is used to project content from a parent component into a child component. It allows for dynamic composition of components and flexible
content insertion.
ng-content directive is used to project content from a parent component into a child component. It allows for dynamic composition of components and flexible
content insertion. It is used by adding the ng-content directive to the template of the child component and using it as a placeholder for the projected content.

The `"RouterOutlet"` directive is used in Angular to define the location where the router should render the components associated with different routes. It acts as a
placeholder for dynamically loaded components.

Angular's `ng-template` directive is used to define a template block that can be conditionally rendered or used as a template for other structural directives like ngIf
and ngFor. It allows for the creation of reusable templates that can be dynamically rendered or applied to elements. It is used by adding the ng-template directive to the template and providing it with a template block to be rendered or used as a template.

Angular's `ngTemplateOutlet` directive is used to render a template dynamically within the current component's view. It allows the reuse of templates and the dynamic
insertion of content. It is used by adding the ngTemplateOutlet directive to an element and providing it with the template reference to be rendered.Angular's ngTemplateOutlet directive is used to render a template dynamically within the current component's view. It allows the reuse of templates and the dynamic insertion of content. It is used by adding the ngTemplateOutlet directive to an element and providing it with the template reference to be rendered.
