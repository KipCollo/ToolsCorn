# CSS frameworks

A CSS framework provides the user with a fully functional CSS stylesheet, allowing them to create a web page by simply coding the HTML with appropriate classes, structure, and IDs. Classes for popular website features like as the footer, slider, navigation bar, hamburger menu, column-based layouts, and so on are already included in the framework.
