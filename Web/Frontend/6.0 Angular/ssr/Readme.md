# SSR in Angular

A normal Angular application executes in the browser, rendering pages in the DOM in response to user actions. Angular Universal executes on the server, generating static application pages that later get bootstrapped on the client. This means that the application generally renders more quickly, giving users a chance to view the application layout before it becomes fully interactive.

`Angular universal`:- Angular Universal also known as server-side rendering is tool which allows server to pre-render Angular application while user hits your website for first time.

Angular Universal is a server-side rendering (SSR) solution for Angular applications. It allows the application to be rendered on the server and sent as fully rendered HTML to the client, improving performance and SEO. Angular Universal is used to create universal (isomorphic) applications that can be rendered both on the server and the client.
