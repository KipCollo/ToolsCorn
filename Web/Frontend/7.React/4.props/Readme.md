# Props

Props make a component reusable.Props are arguments passed into React components.Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.
props stands for properties.

The key prop is used to give a unique identity to each element in a list of components.
It helps React efficiently update and re-render the components by identifying which items have changed, been added, or removed.

The children prop is a special prop that allows you to pass components, elements, or text as children to other components. It enables the composition of components and
the creation of more flexible and reusable component APIs.

React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.

To send props into a component, use the same syntax as HTML attributes:

```jsx
function App(){
    return (
      <Car name="Toyota" color="red"/>
      <Car name="Mercedes" color="blue"/>
      )
}

export default App;
```

The component receives the argument as a props object:
 
```jsx
function Car(props){
    return (
      <>
      <h1>{props.name}</h1>
      <p>{props.color}</p>
      <p>{props.ratings}</p>
      </>
      )
}

export default Car;
```

If you have a variable to send, and not a string as in the example above, you just put the variable name inside curly brackets:

```jsx
function App(){
    return (
      <Car 
         name="Toyota"
         color="red"
         ratings={4}
         isCheap ={true}
         comments={[{author:"", body:"",title=""},{author:"", body:"",title=""}]}
      />
      <Car 
         name="Mercedes" 
         color="blue"
         ratings={5}
         isCheap={false}
         comments={[{author:"", body:"",title=""},{author:"", body:"",title=""}]}
      />
      )
}

export default App;
```
