# Lifecycle

React lifecycle methods are special methods that are called at specific points in acomponent's lifecycle. These methods include componentDidMount,
componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount, and many others.

The shouldComponentUpdate() method is a lifecycle method in React that
determines whether a component should re-render or not. By implementing this
method and returning false under certain conditions, you can optimize the
performance of your application.
