## Conditional Rendering

In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.

Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like [if](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else) or the [conditional operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.

`if Statement`:- We can use the if JavaScript operator to decide which component to render.

```jsx
function MissedGoal() {
  return <h1>MISSED!</h1>;
}

function MadeGoal() {
  return <h1>Goal!</h1>;
}

function Goal(props) {
  const isGoal = props.isGoal;
  if (isGoal) {
    return <MadeGoal/>;
  }
  return <MissedGoal/>;
}
```

`Logical && Operator`:- Another way to conditionally render a React component is by using the && operator.

```jsx
function Garage(props) {
  const cars = props.cars;
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Garage</h1>
      {cars.length > 0 &&
        <h2>
          You have {cars.length} cars in your garage.
        </h2>
      }
    </>
  );
}
```

If cars.length is equates to true, the expression after && will render.

`Ternary Operator`:- Another way to conditionally render elements is by using a ternary operator.

```jsx
function Goal(props) {
  const isGoal = props.isGoal;
  return (
    <>
      { isGoal ? <MadeGoal/> : <MissedGoal/> }
    </>
  );
}
```
