# Testing

A key to building software that meets requirements without defects is testing. Software testing helps developers know they are building the right software. When tests are run as part of the development process (often with continuous integration tools), they build confidence and prevent regressions in the code.

1. `Jest`:- Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. It works with projects using: Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue and more!
2. `Vitest`:- Vitest is a fast Vite-native unit test framework with out-of-box ESM, TypeScript and JSX support.
Works on React, Vue, Svelte and more projects created with Vite
3. `React Testing Library`:- The React Testing Library is a very lightweight solution for testing React components. It provides light utility functions on top of react-dom and react-dom/test-utils, in a way that encourages better testing practices. Its primary guiding principle is: The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.
4. `Cypress`:- Cypress framework is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework built on top of Mocha – a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and convenient. It also uses a BDD/TDD assertion library and a browser to pair with any JavaScript testing framework.
5. `Playwright`:- Playwright Test was created specifically to accommodate the needs of end-to-end testing. Playwright supports all modern rendering engines including Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox. Test on Windows, Linux, and macOS, locally or on CI, headless or headed with native mobile emulation of Google Chrome for Android and Mobile Safari.Playwright leverages the DevTools protocol to write powerful, stable automated tests.Playwright can actually see into and control the browser rather than relying on a middle translation layer, it allows for the simulation of more insightful and relevant user scenarios.
6. `Enzyme`:- Shallow rendering, using tools like Enzyme's shallow(), only renders the component itself, without rendering its child components. Full rendering, using tools like Enzyme's mount(), renders the full component tree, including child components.
7. `Mocha`
8. `Jasmine`
