# Portals

Portals provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

React portals allow you to render children components into a different DOM subtree
outside of the parent component's hierarchy. They are useful for cases where you
need to render a component outside of its parent's DOM hierarchy, such as modal
dialogs or tooltips.
