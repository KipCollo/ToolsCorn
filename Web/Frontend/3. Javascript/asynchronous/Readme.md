# Async

## difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming

- Synchronous programming: Code is executed sequentially, blocking the following code from executing until the current task is complete.
- Asynchronous programming: Code can execute without waiting for the previous code to complete, often using callbacks, promises, or async/await.

## Difference between promise and callback

- Promise: Provides a more readable and manageable way to handle asynchronous operations, with methods like then, catch, and finally.
- Callback: A function passed into another function as an argument to be executed later. Can lead to "callback hell" with nested callbacks.
