# HTML Tags(<> & </>)

Each tag starts with a tag opener(a less than sign(<>)) and ends with a tag closer(a greater than sign(</>)).Many tags have corresponding closing tags which identical except for a slash after the tag opener.
Some tags take parameters,called attributes.The attributes are given after the tag,separated by spaces.Certain attributes have an effect simply by their presence,others are followed by an equals sign and a value.The name of tags and attributes are not case sensitive:they may be in lower,upper or mixed case with exactly the same meaning.

`Title`:- The title of a document is given between title tags:

<TITLE></TITLE>

The text between the opening and the closing tags is a title for hypertext node.There should be only one title in any node.
The title is not strictly part of the text of the document,but is an attribute of the node.It may not contain anchors,paragraph marks,or highlighting.The title may be used to identify the node in a history list,to label the window displaying node.
