# Software Engineering

Software engineering is a branch of computer science, which uses well-defined engineering concepts required to produce efficient, durable, scalable, in-budget and on-time software products.

`software` - Computer programs and associated documentation.Software products may be developed for a particular customer or may be developed for a general market.

The business environment relies heavily on software for many functions - from automated traffic control systems to complex manufacturing processes, and Software Engineers are crucial in the development of software that provides real solutions. A Software Engineer needs to address the entire software development lifecycle - to analyse the needs, and then design, test and develop software in order to meet those needs.

## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (software process)

The systems development life cycle (SDLC) is the process of determining how an information system (IS) can support business needs, designing the system, building it, and delivering it to users.

A software life cycle model (also called process model) is a descriptive and diagrammatic representation of the software life cycle
A life cycle model maps the different activities performed on a software product from its inception to retirement.

Building an information system using the SDLC follows a set of four fundamental phases: planning, analysis, design, and implementation.
Each phase is itself composed of a series of steps, which rely on techniques that produce deliverables (specific documents and files that explain various elements of the system).

`Planning`:- The planning phase is the fundamental process of understanding why an information system should be built and determining how the project team will go about building it. 

It has two steps:
1. Project Initiation.
2. Project Management.


`Analysis`:- The analysis phase answers the questions of who will use the system, what the system will do, and where and when it will be used.
During this phase, the project team investigates any current system(s), identifies improvement opportunities, and develops a concept for the new system. 
This phase has four steps:-
1. analysis strategy.
2. Requirements Gathering & analysis
3. Requirements specification/definition.
4. Requirements validation.


`Design`:- The design phase decides how the system will operate in terms of the hardware, software, and network infrastructure that will be in place; the user interface, forms, and reports that will be used; and the specific programs, databases, and files that will be needed. Although most of the strategic decisions about the system are made in the development of the system concept during the analysis phase, the steps in the design phase determine exactly how the system will operate.
The design phase has four steps:
1. Architectural design
2. Interface design.
3. Component design.
4. Database design.


`Implementation`:- The final phase in the SDLC is the implementation phase, during which the system is actually built (or purchased, in the case of a packaged software design and installed). This is the phase that usually gets the most attention, because for most systems it is the longest and most expensive single part of the development process.
This phase has three steps:
1. System construction.
2. Deployment.
3. Maintenance.
