# SQL [Structured Query Language]

SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is a language used to manage data stored in a relational database.
Relational databases organize data in the form of tables.

## Roadmap

1. Introduction - Includes:-
   - SQL definitions,Why learn It,Database and Types,SQL Commands,SQL Components, SQL Coding Style
2. Query Data(SELECT) :- SELECT,FROM,WHERE,ORDER BY, GROUP BY,HAVING,DISTINCT,TOP, QUERY ORDER & EXECUTION.
3. Data Definition(DDL):- CREATE,ALTER,DROP
4. Data Manipulation(DML):- INSERT, UPDATE,DELETE
5. Filtering Data:-
   - Comparison Operators
   - Logical Operators
   - BETWEEN, IN,LIKE
6. Combining Data:-
   - Joining Data - Basic Joins(INNER,LEFT,RIGHT,FULL Join), Advanced Joins(LEFT,RIGHT,FULL Anti Join,Cross Join)
   - SET Operators - UNION,UNION ALL,EXCEPT,INTERSECT
7. Row-Level Functions:- String, Number, date & time,Null functions, Case Statements
8. Aggregate & Analytical Functions:- aggregate Functions,Window basics,Window Aggregate func,Window Ranking Func, Window Value Func.
9. Advanced SQL Techniques:- Subqueries, CTE, Views,CTAS table & Temp tables,Stored Procedure,Triggers
10. Performance and Optimizations:- Indexes,Partitions.
11. AI & SQL

`Comments` - Comments are written to make our code more readable for other programmers. They are meant for humans only and are ignored by the DBMS
To add comments to our program, 

- we type two hyphens, followed by a space.
- Alternatively, we can also use the # symbol as shown below:
- Last, but not least, if we want to type multiple lines comments, we can use the /*...*/ symbols:


```sql
-- Using SELECT to display messages

# This is another way to add comment

/* This is a comment
This is also a comment
This is the third comment */
```
