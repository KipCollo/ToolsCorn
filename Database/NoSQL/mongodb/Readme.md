# SQL vs NoSQL

When discussing databases, it's essential to understand the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases, as each has its own set of advantages and limitations. In this section, we'll briefly compare and contrast the two, so you can determine which one suits your needs better.

## SQL Databases

SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are also known as relational databases. They have a predefined schema, and data is stored in tables consisting of rows and columns. SQL databases follow the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure reliable transactions. Some popular SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.

**Advantages of SQL databases:**

- **Predefined schema**: Ideal for applications with a fixed structure.
- **ACID transactions**: Ensures data consistency and reliability.
- **Support for complex queries**: Rich SQL queries can handle complex data relationships and aggregation operations.
- **Scalability**: Vertical scaling by adding more resources to the server (e.g., RAM, CPU).

**Limitations of SQL databases:**

- **Rigid schema**: Data structure updates are time-consuming and can lead to downtime.
- **Scaling**: Difficulties in horizontal scaling and sharding of data across multiple servers.
- **Not well-suited for hierarchical data**: Requires multiple tables and JOINs to model tree-like structures.

## NoSQL Databases

NoSQL (Not only SQL) databases refer to non-relational databases, which don't follow a fixed schema for data storage. Instead, they use a flexible and semi-structured format like JSON documents, key-value pairs, or graphs. MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Couchbase are some popular NoSQL databases.

**Advantages of NoSQL databases:**

- **Flexible schema**: Easily adapts to changes without disrupting the application.
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling by partitioning data across multiple servers (sharding).
- **Fast**: Designed for faster read and writes, often with a simpler query language.
- **Handling large volumes of data**: Better suited to managing big data and real-time applications.
- **Support for various data structures**: Different NoSQL databases cater to various needs, like document, graph, or key-value stores.

**Limitations of NoSQL databases:**

- **Limited query capabilities**: Some NoSQL databases lack complex query and aggregation support or use specific query languages.
- **Weaker consistency**: Many NoSQL databases follow the BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) properties that provide weaker consistency guarantees than ACID-compliant databases.

## MongoDB: A NoSQL Database

This guide focuses on MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database that uses a document-based data model. MongoDB has been designed with flexibility, performance, and scalability in mind. With its JSON-like data format (BSON) and powerful querying capabilities, MongoDB is an excellent choice for modern applications dealing with diverse and large-scale data.

## MongoDB

MongoDB is a database management system designed to rapidly develop web applications and internet infrastructure. The data model and persistence strategies are built for high read-and-write throughput and the ability to scale easily with automatic failover.

MongoDB’s document format is based on JSON, a popular scheme for storing arbitrary data structures. JSON is an acronym for JavaScript Object Notation.JSON structures consist of keys and values, and they can nest arbitrarily deep. They’re analogous to the dictionaries and hash maps of other programming languages.

A document-based data model can represent rich, hierarchical data structures. It’s often possible to do without the multitable joins common to relational databases.

## Command-line tools

MongoDB is bundled with several command-line utilities:

1. `mongodump` and `mongorestore` — Standard utilities for backing up and restoring a database. mongodump saves the database’s data in its native BSON format and
thus is best used for backups only; this tool has the advantage of being usable for hot backups, which can easily be restored with mongorestore.
2. `mongoexport` and `mongoimport` — Export and import JSON, CSV, and TSV7 data; this is useful if you need your data in widely supported formats. mongoimport
can also be good for initial imports of large data sets, although before importing,
it’s often desirable to adjust the data model to take best advantage of MongoDB.
In such cases, it’s easier to import the data through one of the drivers using a
custom script.
mongosniff—A wire-sniffing tool for viewing operations sent to the database. It
essentially translates the BSON going over the wire to human-readable shell
statements.
mongostat—Similar to iostat, this utility constantly polls MongoDB and the
system to provide helpful stats, including the number of operations per second
(inserts, queries, updates, deletes, and so on), the amount of virtual memory
allocated, and the number of connections to the server.
mongotop—Similar to top, this utility polls MongoDB and shows the amount of
time it spends reading and writing data in each collection.
mongoperf—Helps you understand the disk operations happening in a running
MongoDB instance.
mongooplog—Shows what’s happening in the MongoDB oplog.
Bsondump—Converts BSON files into human-readable
