# Object Oriented Databases

Relational database model places more emphasis on content rather than links for data retrieval. This is limiting in the kind of data that could be held, the rigidity of the structure, and the lack of support for data types such as graphics, xml, 2D and 3D data.


With the advent of Object Oriented methodologies and languages integration of database capabilities with object oriented programming language provided a unified programming environment. This led to the development of Object Oriented Databases (OODB) and Object Oriented Database Management System (OODBMS) where objects are stored in databases rather than data such as integers, strings or real numbers. This topic discusses more of OODBMS.
