# Relational

A relational database is a (most commonly digital) database based on the relational model of data, as proposed by E. F. Codd in 1970. A system used to maintain relational databases is a relational database management system (RDBMS). Many relational database systems are equipped with the option of using the SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and maintaining the database.

## Knex

Knex.js is a "batteries included" SQL query builder for PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, MSSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite3, Better-SQLite3, Oracle, and Amazon Redshift designed to be flexible, portable, and fun to use.

## TypeORM

TypeORM is an ORM that can run in NodeJS, Browser, Cordova, PhoneGap, Ionic, React Native, NativeScript, Expo, and Electron platforms and can be used with TypeScript and JavaScript (ES5, ES6, ES7, ES8). Its goal is to always support the latest JavaScript features and provide additional features that help you to develop any kind of application that uses databases - from small applications with a few tables to large scale enterprise applications with multiple databases.

TypeORM supports both [Active Record](https://typeorm.io/active-record-data-mapper#what-is-the-active-record-pattern) and [Data Mapper](https://typeorm.io/active-record-data-mapper#what-is-the-data-mapper-pattern) patterns, unlike all other JavaScript ORMs currently in existence, which means you can write high quality, loosely coupled, scalable, maintainable applications the most productive way.

## Sequelize

Sequelize is an easy-to-use and promise-based Node.js ORM tool for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, and Snowflake. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.

## What is an ORM

An ORM is known as Object Relational Mapper. This is a tool or a level of abstraction which maps(converts) data in a relational database into programmatic objects that can be manipulated by a programmer using a programming language(usually an OOP language). ORMs solely exist to map the details between two data sources which due to a mismatch cannot coexist together.

## Prisma

Prisma is an ORM that helps app developers build faster and make fewer errors. Combined with its Data Platform developers gain reliability and visibility when working with databases.

## Native drivers

NativeDriver is an implementation of the WebDriver API which drives the UI of a native application rather than a web application. It extends the WebDriver API in a few key places, and re-interprets the existing API for native applications.
