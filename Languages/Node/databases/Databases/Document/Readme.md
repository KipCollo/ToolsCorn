# Document

A document database is a type of nonrelational database that is designed to store and query data as JSON-like documents. Document databases make it easier for developers to store and query data in a database by using the same document-model format they use in their application code. The flexible, semistructured, and hierarchical nature of documents and document databases allows them to evolve with applicationsâ€™ needs.

## Mongoose

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.

- Connecting to Database

Install mongoose library

```bash
npm install mongoose
```

```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
mongoose.connect("mongodb:127.0.0.1:27017/dbName")//connect method returns a promise
        .then(()=>console.log("Connected.."))
        .catch(err=>console.error(err))
```

- Defining schemas.Schema defines the shape of documents within collection in db.Its specifi in mongoose and it's not available in mongoDB.Schem class takes objects.Schema can take Strings,Number,Boolean,Date,Buffer(store binary),array,ObjectID(assigning unique numbers)

```js

const studentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name:String,
    age:number
})
```

TODO Understand what is a model

- Models: Schema is compiled into a model.The model maps to Document in MongoDB.

```js
const Student= mongoose.model("Student",studentSchema);
const std1=new Student({
    name:"Collins",
    age:21
})
```

- Saving Data to Database.We use save method of model object.The save method is asynchronous i.e the result of the operation will be ready in the future.It returns asved object with the unique id generated b MongoDB.

```js
const result=await std1.save()
```

Note: When using await, the code should be in async function.

- Retrieving Data from Databse.You use the querying methods in Model class.You can perform several operations of returned data from table i.e sorting,limit

```js
Student.find()//Returns a promise
```

## Prisma

Prisma provides an open source next-generation ORM in the TypeScript ecosystem. It offers a dedicated API for relation filters. It provides an abstraction layer that makes you more productive compared to writing SQL. Prisma currently supports `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL`, `SQL Server`, `SQLite`, `MongoDB` and `CockroachDB`.

## Native Drivers

Another way to connect to different databases in Node.js is to use the official native drivers provided by the database. For example, here is the [list of drivers by MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/)
