# Document

A document database is a type of nonrelational database that is designed to store and query data as JSON-like documents. Document databases make it easier for developers to store and query data in a database by using the same document-model format they use in their application code. The flexible, semistructured, and hierarchical nature of documents and document databases allows them to evolve with applicationsâ€™ needs.

MongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program.Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schemas.

## Mongoose

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.

## Prisma

Prisma provides an open source next-generation ORM in the TypeScript ecosystem. It offers a dedicated API for relation filters. It provides an abstraction layer that makes you more productive compared to writing SQL. Prisma currently supports `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL`, `SQL Server`, `SQLite`, `MongoDB` and `CockroachDB`.

## Native Drivers

Another way to connect to different databases in Node.js is to use the official native drivers provided by the database. For example, here is the [list of drivers by MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/)
