# Ecosystem

Have a look at the linked nodes for different tools and frameworks that you can use to build your projects.

## Formatting

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter with support for JavaScript, HTML, CSS, YAML, Markdown, GraphQL Schemas. By far the biggest reason for adopting Prettier is to stop all the on-going debates over styles.

## Linting

With ESLint you can impose the coding standard using a certain set of standalone rules.

## Build Tools

Task runners automatically execute commands and carry out processes behind the scenes. This helps automate your workflow by performing mundane, repetitive tasks that you would otherwise waste an egregious amount of time repeating yourself.

Common usages of task runners include numerous development tasks such as: spinning up development servers, compiling code (ex. SCSS to CSS), running linters, serving files up from a local port on your computer, and many more!
