# Unit and Integration Testing

In Rust language, the concept of unit integration encompasses writing tests for individual units of your code, typically a function or method, as well as for multiple units that interact with each other. Unit tests are written in the same files as the code and are used to verify the functionality of a single unit of software in isolation. On the other hand, integration tests are stored in an entirely different directory and are meant to test how multiple components or modules of your application work together. They rely on combining units of code and testing the group, identifying issues that may not be visible when units are tested in isolation.
