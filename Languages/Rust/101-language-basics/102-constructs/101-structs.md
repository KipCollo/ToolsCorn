# Structs

In Rust, a struct is a custom data type used for grouping related values together into one entity. Structs are similar to classes in other programming languages. Essentially, each `struct` creates a new type that we can use to streamline complex data handling.

There are three types of `struct` in Rust: classic 'C' structs, tuple structs, and unit structs.

- **Classic 'C' structs** are named-field structs and are the most commonly used.
- **Tuple structs**, while not being common, are useful when you want to couple together just a few data points that don't need field names.
- **Unit structs** are useful in situations where you want to implement a **trait** on some type, but don't have any data that you want to store in the type itself.
