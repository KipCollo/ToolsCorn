# Constructs

In Rust, "constructs" refer to different elements used to build the structure of the program. Constructs includes variables, functions, data types, control flow statements, and more.

- **Variables** store data, and their immutable or mutable status is determined at their declaration with `let` and `let mut`, respectively.
- **Functions** are reusable blocks of code defined by the `fn` keyword.
- **Data types** in Rust are static and must be declared upfront. These include simple _primitive_ types, like integers, booleans (`bool`), and floats, as well as _complex_ types like arrays, tuples, all the custom types you declare yourself, and many more types you might use from Rust's standard library or community crates you download.
- **Control flow** structures help direct the flow of code execution. These include `if`, `else`, `loop`, `while`, and `for` blocks, to name a few. Exception handling in Rust leverages the `Result<T, E>` and `Option<T>` enums alongside the `match` construct's ability to perform concise pattern matching.

As a Rust programmer, you'll utilize many of the language's constructs like the ones above. These pieces come together at your fingertips to structure your program in a safe and efficient manner.
