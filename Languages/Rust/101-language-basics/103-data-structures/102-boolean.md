# Boolean

`Boolean` in Rust is a primitive data type that encapsulates the truth value. It is represented by `bool` keyword and can hold two values either `true` or `false`. If you cast a bool into an integer, `true` will be `1` and `false` will be `0`. Operations like logical `AND (&&)`, logical `OR (||)`, and logical `NOT (!)` can be performed on these types of values. Boolean is primarily used in conditional statements like `if`, `while` etc. For example, `let is_raining: bool = true;` where `is_raining` is a boolean variable holding the value `true`.
