# Control Flow Constructs

In Rust, control flow is managed through various structures, like `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, and `match`. The `if` and `else` structures are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. Similar to other languages, `while` and `for` are used for looping over a block of code. The `while` loop repeats a block of code until the condition is false, and the `for` loop is used to iterate over a collection of values, such as an array or a range. Rust's `match` structure, which is similar to switch statements in other languages, is a powerful tool used for pattern matching: it checks through different cases defined by the programmer and executes the block where the match is found.
