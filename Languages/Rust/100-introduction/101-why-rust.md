# Why use Rust?

Rust is a system programming language that aims to provide memory safety, concurrency, and performance with a focus on zero cost abstractions. It was originally created by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, with contributions from Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript. Rust is appreciated for the solutions it provides to common programming language issues. Its emphasis on safety, speed, and support for concurrent programming, as well as its robust type system, are just a few reasons why developers choose Rust.
