# Programming Languages

`Go` - Go is an open source programming language supported by Google. Go can be used to write cloud services, CLI tools, used for API development, and much more.

`C++` - C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop operating systems, browsers, games, and so on. C++ supports different ways of programming like procedural, object-oriented, functional, and so on. This makes C++ powerful as well as flexible.

`Ruby` - Ruby is a high-level, interpreted programming language that blends Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. Ruby focuses on simplicity and productivity along with a syntax that reads and writes naturally. Ruby supports procedural, object-oriented and functional programming and is dynamically typed.Known for role in web development and scripting applications.Popular framework is **Ruby on rails**.

`Python` - Python is a well known programming language which is both a strongly typed and a dynamically typed language. Being an interpreted language, code is executed as soon as it is written and the Python syntax allows for writing code in functional, procedural or object-oriented programmatic ways.

`JavaScript` - Apart from being used in the browser, JavaScript is also used in backend e.g. using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) or [Deno](https://deno.land/) for writing server-side code in JavaScript.

If you pick up JavaScript for the Backend, my personal recommendation would be to learn [JavaScript](/javascript) and then go with [Node.js](/nodejs) as it is the most popular and widely used option. Also, I would recommend learning TypeScript later on as you continue with your backend development Journey; it's a superset of JavaScript and is used in many projects.

`PHP` - PHP is a general purpose scripting language often used for making dynamic and interactive Web pages. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group and supported by PHP Foundation. PHP supports procedural and object-oriented styles of programming with some elements of functional programming as well.

`C#` - C# (pronounced "C sharp") is a general purpose programming language made by Microsoft. It is used to perform different tasks and can be used to create web apps, games, mobile apps, etc.

`Java` - Java is general-purpose language, primarily used for Internet-based applications.
It was created in 1995 by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and is one of the most popular options for backend developers.

`Rust` - Rust is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety, speed, and concurrency. It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using garbage collection.
