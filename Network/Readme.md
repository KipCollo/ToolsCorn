# Network

## The Internet

Internet is interconnection of different networks. It evolved from the ARPANET,developed in 1969 by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the
U.S. Department of Defense. It was the first operational packet-switching network. The network was so successful that ARPA applied the same packet-switching technology to tactical radio communication (packet radio) and to satellite communication (SATNET). The need for interworking between these led to Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn of ARPA developing methods and protocols for such internetworking, which led eventually to the development of TCP/IP.
