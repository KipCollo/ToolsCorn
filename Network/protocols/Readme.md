# Protocols

Protocols are rules or guidelines that regulate the following characteristics of a network: access method, allowed physical topologies, types of cabling and
speed of data transfer. Protocols can be implemented either in hardware or software or a mixture of both the lower layers is implemented in hardware, with
the higher layers being implemented in software as follows:-

1. Protocols are how computers on a network communicate.
2. Protocols may determine packet size, information in the headers, and how data is stored in the packet.
3. Both sides of the conversation must understand these rules for a successful transmission.
4. Most protocols actually consist of several protocols grouped together in a suite.
5. Protocols are how computers on a network communicate. Rules governing communicate between LAN devices.
6. Protocols may determine packet size, information in the headers, and how data is stored in the packet.
7. Both sides of the conversation must understand these rules for a successful transmission.

## TCP/IP Protocol suite

TCP/IP protocol suite is made of five layers: physical, data link, network, transport, and application. The first four layers provide physical standards,
network interfaces, internetworking, and transport functions that correspond to Protocols the first four layers of the OSI model.

Types of Protocols:-

- Network protocols
- Transport protocols
- Application protocols
